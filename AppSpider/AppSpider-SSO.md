Enter “QL”  (for “Company Name”) … and click “Sign In”

Note: You may also need log into the QL Gateway once, but any subsequent logins will not require you to log into the Gateway anymore - so you can now log into AppSpider easily using the "SAML sign in" button!



Note2: Your new account will automatically be created, and be added to the “Quicken Loans” client (and you'll be auto-added as a “QL Reporter” user of the AppSpider system) – allowing you to create, configure, and run dynamic security scans!
