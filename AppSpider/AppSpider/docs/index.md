# AppSpider is QL's recommended tool for DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

DAST is black-box security testing methodology in which an application is tested automatically. A team member using **AppSpider** examines their application for security vulnerabilities, while it is running (deployed). AppSpider runs multiple types of attacks and processes, and tries to hack an application just like an attacker would.



You can also add AppSpider scanning into your deployment pipeline, for automated scanning every time you make a code change or deploy your application.
