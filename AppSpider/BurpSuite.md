# [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/)
This tool is a "manual testing tool" that allows users to spoof / manipulate service calls for pen-testing + investigation.

 

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

Burp gives you full control, letting you combine advanced manual techniques with state-of-the-art automation, to make your work faster, more effective, and more fun.

- An intercepting [Proxy](http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html), which lets you inspect and modify traffic between your browser and the target application.
- An application-aware [Spider](http://portswigger.net/burp/spider.html), for crawling content and functionality.
- An advanced web application [Scanner](http://portswigger.net/burp/scanner.html), for automating the detection of numerous types of vulnerability.
- An [Intruder](http://portswigger.net/burp/intruder.html) tool, for performing powerful customized attacks to find and exploit unusual vulnerabilities.

- A [Sequencer](http://portswigger.net/burp/sequencer.html) tool, for testing the randomness of session tokens.
