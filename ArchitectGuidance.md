This space is dedicated to collecting/collating my thoughts on what it means to be an architect (esp. wrt. Enterprise Quality Architect afaik)



"Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!" - Lewis Carol, Alice in Wonderland





At the time of writing this, I am struggling personally with defining our team's/enterprise "Quality Roles" â€“ and how we should be evaluated: specifically, what each role should look like, with respect to: knowledge, behaviors, skills 



I'm going to detail my thought processes during this journey, in a "blog format" - 'cuz it's fun for me.



Having since previously defined the roles within: TRAC, MAP, and during MANY mentoring conversations -- our company/industry has evolved, and it is now time to re-evaluate and enhance the existing roles:

Quality Analyst (QA), Quality Developer (QD), Quality Engineer (QE), Sr. Quality Engineer (Sr. QE), Software Engineer in Test (SET), Sr. Software Engineer in Test (Sr. SET)


I'm taking another crack at collecting my thoughts once again on this topic, as I compile this guidance - Which is a more formalized/structured collection of "stuff" that I think makes sense for these roles.



As a team (QAPOW), we also created this: Software Quality Responsibility Comparison Matrix



And ideally, I'll be using the Software Quality Responsibility Comparison Matrix and THIS page, to drive/define the pen-ultimate content for this: EQA Revamp



I've always said that my role as an architect, as I've defined it, is to drive "enterprise quality" through 3 core concepts:

People
Technical / Tooling
Processes / Thought


... This means I'm always focusing on improving my skills/knowledge/behaviors on the following topics - so that I can help others gain these as well:

Leadership
Guidance
Influencing (& other Soft Skills)
Communication
Technical Knowledge & Capabilities & Analytical
Design & Architectural Patterns
Documentation
Processes (& Standardization)


... Now I'm going to define what I think helps drive each of the 3 core concepts (identified above)

People
"A leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk" - Various Sources



People Overview:

Influence
Grow Talent (Coaching/Mentoring)
Share Knowledge
Motivate!


Technical / Tooling
"Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is." - Ralph Johnson

 

Technical/Tooling Overview:

Build a scaffold/POC
Design & Architectural Patterns
Standards
4 Cs: C4 Model: Explosively Improving Your Architecture/Design Diagramming Skills
Select a toolbox (everything is a trade-off!)
API Definitions, schemas, data models
Code Metrics!
Always be Learning


Processes/Thought
"Plans are worthless, but planning is EVERYTHING." - Dwight D. Eisenhower



Processes/Thought Overview:
- Big Picture Thinking (Seriously!! Step back and think - LOTs of articles/sources say this is critical)
- Pre-Identifying Problems (before they become problems) & Mitigation Planning (Problem Definition > Solution Design > Implementation > Enhance!)
 - Problem Definition : 
  - Problem Statement, Supporting Analysis, Current Docs
 - Solution Design:
  - Identify potential solutions to experiment/POC
  - Models + Diagrams!
- Technology & Tooling selection
 - POCs
 - Ubiquitous/Exact language
 - Identify Metrics to show progress on experiment/POC (baseline + incremental!)
- Implementation:
 - API Definitions, schemas, data models
 - Production grade code
 - Standards
 - Design/Arch Patterns
- Enhancements:
 - Rinse-Lather-Repeat
- Champion Process:
- Drive to Improve / Streamline / Lean / Remove "bottle-neck constraints" (first/only)
 - Set Culture and Values: (Examples: unit testing, quality gates, code metrics/SonarQube, etc.)
- Mindsets (capturing team member "hearts and minds")
- Vision/Mission for a concept > Buy-in and selling an idea > Showing benefits
 - Be a Change Agent
- Simplicity (GUMP):
- Keep it STUPID SIMPLE 
- Documentation > Well, duh, if you know me (smile)
- Experimentation
- Curiosity
- Ask a LOT of questions
