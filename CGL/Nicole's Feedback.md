## Patterns / Areas for Target Improvement:

**Approachability:**

- Open to ideas and thought of others


**Communication**

- Practice active listening
- **Written Communication Skills**




\*\* It is evident from the "Communication Skills" comments that "gumping up" written communication is desirable, and is related heavily to "Simplicity is Genius" - Summary: Often my emails contain too much content/clarity, resulting in "Too Long, Didn't Read" (TLDR). Verbal communication should also be more measured, slower to allow for others to catch up, and straightforward (less "mental/logical jumps" to the conclusion, and more helping lead others to the same final result, by talking it through - what seems self-evident after having already been thought through internally).
