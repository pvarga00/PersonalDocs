# CQ TL Role: Personal Plan

Ideally, we will have 2 teams, 3-4 pods each which includes a floating pod once we hire additional team members. Each leader will lead anywhere between 8-12(max) team members, this will allow us to be better organized with more support and focus.  The position is open internally and externally.


The Team Leader - Quality:
Oversees a cross functional team executing on quality enablement and improvement strategies for the enterprise.

They lead initiatives and continuous improvement programs to increase the reliability while maintaining quality at speed.

The leader needs to be highly organized and flexible, someone who can handle multiple Quality Pods focusing on various initiatives in multiple areas of technology. 

The team leader is responsible for quality improvements of products and teams, providing standards, best practices, processes and tools while measuring success and business impact.

This individual will apply effective communication, analytical and problem-solving skills to lead, grow the team, resolve quality, scalability and reliability challenges in timely manner.

Focus on Team (Things to consider/do)

More focus on Architectural/Technical concepts / training
Note: In addition to the "soft-skills track" training
Enterprise Quality Initiatives / Standards: With two QAPOW teams: One can focus on "POD tactics" / other can focus on more "Enterprise tactics" (and swap accordingly)
Continue TGIF concept : flip-flop/swap presenting each week with Gajan (for larger group) or continue on with the idea (for smaller/focused team)




What I consider being "Successful within the TL Role":

“Team Success”:
TM Growth: Professionally and Personally
Team Impact > Working on the "Right Things" and staying accountable
TM "Happiness":
Outlet Surveys
1-1 feedback
"External" feedback
TM Exit Interview feedback
Continually polling/asking "everyone"
Team Member Metrics
Figuring out measurements and improving on each of the aforementioned categories




Succession Planning Pod:

We’ll Figure it out:
In the interim however; I will perform the duties in both roles, progressively swapping percentage of time focused on each
Until we determine a "secondary" to train/level-up as a successor


Preparing For This Interview: (I intend to approach the interview as conversational style / and watch out for any "gotchas"):

Update my Resume
Build up a "Portfolio"
Vision/Leadership style - Characteristics
Next Steps: How I’ll run the Team/Each Pods/CQ
Short Term: 30/60/90+ day plan > Long Term (1y + 5y)
Including measurements for success

Leadership Q&A:
Why am I interested in leadership?

I find it deeply personally satisfying in helping to guide and develop others
It is especially gratifying to watch people grow, flourish, and excel from the guidance that I've offered - and explore/implement new solutions with their special flavor on it
From general career advice, technical/subject matter expertise offered, to general help and life coaching - I find it rewarding to help others find the paths/solutions that are right for them
I seek to enable others to possess and grow the tools that they'll need to be self-sufficient, and know how to better solve for future opportunities and goals
Planning for and tracking goal achievement, ensuring the celebration of successes, and being able to adapt to changes - These are all things that I try to instill in others that I've helped mentor and coach...
I love doing it, and I want to learn and grow to be even better at it in future situations




What have I done to prepare myself for leadership?

I am continually looking to improve on my current leadership skill set and enhance my knowledge: reading numerous leadership books, going over technical docs/blogs, listening to self-improvement audiobooks, etc.
Individual Mentoring/Coaching: across many years of experience, especially within QL
Especially most recently: I have already been actively/directly mentoring/coaching each of the 5 Quality Champions and Shams
Offering career planning/advice
Acting as a Technical Advisor for many interactions
I created the QAPOW Mentoring Program guidance
I was part of the over-all TRAC program - and I lead a virtual sub-team, and was a primary contributor, to define the TRAC roles: Software Quality Engineering and Architecture Skills
I was a primary contributor to the MAP program, specifically for: Architect MAP
I was the primary leader/driver for a few QL Communities, most specifically: Quality, Software Craftsmanship, Architecture
I am continually learning and honing my leadership and communication skills
NOTE: There are many other initiatives and opportunities that I am exploring to improve upon and grow my current leadership skills, but the previously listed achievements are those that I am especially proud of, that highlight the types of actions that have helped/are helping me to improve upon my leadership abilities



What do I think is my leadership style?

I have seen great success come from truly living the "servant leader" role. It makes sense theoretically, I've seen other leaders use it, and it has worked well for me in the past
I believe that a leader has to provide / collaboratively help the team to define:
an overarching future vision
the mission to support the future vision
and a plan to achieve the desired goals of the mission
and offer support and encouragement to the team in accomplishing the goals of the plan
A leader has to guide and support (and not micromanage) : Especially critical for any team of highly skilled individuals - you need to provide the right method of leadership for the right situation: For example High Support / Low Direction (S3) - but still ensuring/maintaining high alignment, even while the team may not be cohesive/in close physical proximity

Leadership - The Leadership Sandbox


What are my greatest leadership strengths?

I am very people oriented: I care about others / have strong empathy
Team member growth focused: I have already been particularly focused on Team Member Development & Leveling-up
I am continually committed to Relationship Building / Presence
I have a deep passion for helping/teaching others
Continual commitment to self-improvement (myself and others): Both professionally and personally
I am very adept at Problem Solving
I have deep Knowledge / Experience /  Technical Leadership skills
I can provide Vision/Strategic Thinking
I am very adept at Documentation/Processes
I live the Culture and posses a wealth of practiced Soft Skills : Communication + Adaptability + Negotiation + Accountability


What are my biggest areas of opportunity in leadership?

Focus versus Vision > "Don’t get stretched too thin": 
I am currently involved in many differing projects and initiatives, and often-times I have had to change gears and adapt to newer/differing priorities. This has sometimes resulted in my feeling of "un-fulfillment", as I have had to step away from certain undertakings (temporarily) in order to make progress on other competing/priority tasks
I am aware of this opportunity, and I continually strive to juggle the competing priorities and needs, while continually DRIVING all tasks to DONE
There is a time and a place for all things, and I try balance quick easy accomplishments with longer, more protracted priorities
I am very comfortable in easily adapting to new changes, which is a great trait to have ... WHILE I try to remain laser-focused on the highest priority items at hand
Mitigation/Remediation Plan for this focus area: 
Discipline & adherence to the "plan / prioritized task list"
Staying laser-tight focused on "what's important / urgent"

Secondary Consideration: Staying away from “questionable” comments. Having more sensitivity, being less objectionable. Note: This had been an issue in the past; however, I now balance joviality with professionalism


What does QL leadership look like to me?

Team Member Development
Removing Roadblocks
Strategic Thinking
Talent Development / Collaboration
Relationship Building / Presence




What is my plan / vision for the team?

I intend to implement a "Phased Approach" to my role as a Team Leader:

Short Term (30 days - 6 months): 
During this short-term period I also plan on continuing to support the Originations Technology Pod (OTPod), but gradually transitioning more into the TL role and delegating more to existing Quality Champions (QCs) and others
I will coordinate with Gajan and Karim to determine how best to divvy up our team members based on: skills, knowledge, behaviors, strengths/opportunities - logically orienting team members to best support one another's qualities/styles
Focusing on the success of the pods - driving impact and measuring outcomes/wins (especially with respect to quality related OKRs)
Learn more about each of the team members and build relationships
Plan out career paths / growth opportunities - uniquely suited for each individual's needs
NOTE: I very much appreciate/want to emulate Gajan and Karim's current leadership style - and will continue to implement/align with many of the initiatives already in-progress, while also exploring new opportunities/trainings

Long Term (6 months - 1year): 
While staying flexible, and constantly reevaluating what the team needs, I'd like to explore more Technical Training opportunities as well (similar to the soft-skills courses offered by Keisha/The Journey) - Delving into topics like architectural design patterns / katas for practicing architectural design reviews from a quality perspective (katas for "muscle memory" on being conditioned/good at the skill)
I'd also like to focus more on "Enterprise Wide" quality initiatives: technical standardization, metrics/dashboards, and observability: Exploring new ways to bring visibility, quality, and speed to our application delivery teams
Things I'd like to focus more upon: CI/CD pipelines metadata, application health/monitoring, API design/strategy (semantic versioning standards from API creation and contract testing/PACTs), etc.


Live/Breathe These Words:

"What’s really being an effective leader? It’s being a technical as well as business domain go-to person, it’s really to help clear roadblocks to the team so they can actually move forward. Being a leader as an architect means providing technical help and guidance, it means to help the team make decisions and form those decisions and validate them, and also to provide motivation to the team and support whether it be technical or non-technical support. This is what we’re referring to when we say it’s important to be a leader as an architect."
