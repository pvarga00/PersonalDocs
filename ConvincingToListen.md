### A Masterclass Training Methodology : Orig. Content: Antonia Chenene


## Personal Notes:
- React with balance & strategy (not reactive / frustrated)
- Serene and intentional motivation
- Another person's ACTIONs & BEHAVIORs informs us of a message
- We MUST be consistent

## 5 Common Mistakes in Influencing Others
- Bribes: Unsustainable (ex: no reward == no work)
  - The reward should be doing a good job, on the task itself (esp. for one's self)
- Threats: There are especially long-term, negative consequences to this. You WILL damamge your future relationship.
  - This teaches the recipient that your love/respect/friendship is NOT unconditional. Instead that your love/respect/friendship IS conditional.
  - This path leads to a threatened relationship which leads to emotions of: scared, hidden emotions, and ultimately fear.
- False Promises/Threats: We become unreliable if we don't *always* follow-through 
  - (and they begin to learn that we're liars & they will become increasingly disappointed & begin doubting us, and also possibly becomming liars themselves)
- Giving In: We become tried, frustrated - so we do the task/work ourselves.
  - Folks/kids will learn that we gave up and will continue bad/unhelpful behavior to our requests. This shows them that we gave up and will do the work ourselves
  - This reinforces bad behavior - and will get worse over time
  - We will then get even more overburdened and more tired over time
- Punishment: This is a VERY slippery slope. Just Ewww. We are all learning terrible lessons through either/both physical and emotional suffering. 
  - Folks/kids will learn to hide more and more, with everyone becoming even more resentful, long-term.

## Some Better/More-Effective Strategies to Employ Instead
### Ask Why -- To Understand the cause of Behavior

### Basic Human Needs to Consider for Increasing Internal-Motivation

### 3 Methods to Influence & Get Folks to Listen
1) 
- Start with Empathy
- Use your voice and body to connect
- Identify and acknowledge the recipients emotions
- See things from their perspective
- Let the empathy settle in before guiding again

2) 
- Begin with planning in advance a lot of folks don't have a special time awareness, yet. Seriously. 
  - This trait is slowly developed over time (People don't cement in this concept until 25+ years old typically -- Research it for yourself)
  - Give folks predictability (rules / choices-within-limits)
  - Folks live in the "here and now" -- set time constraints
  - Help 'em transition into habits
  - Use cues/objectives to help transition & remind 'em
- Visual reminders/rules for predicitability
- Break down tasks into tasks into smaller/atomic habits
  - "What step are you on?"
- Routines! --> Future Success

3) Options within Limits (Automonomy) : We need to set limits consistently!
3.1) Engage your Empathy
3.2) Repeat your limits (rules, values, limits, requests)
3.3) Offer 2 options within limits (options/choices!)


... All of our pysche needs MUST be met within SAFETY. Folks/kids need to feel: SAFE, LOVED, and GUIDED ... gifted through our actions of: Consistency & Predictability & Love & Patience.
