* * *

## Phase 2: Quicken Loans Teams

#### Product Lab

Before our client facing teams can talk to clients about products, our Capital Markets team creates a variety of loan options. The Product Lab, in Capital Markets, is responsible for developing the products that bankers can use to help meet our clients’ personal and financial goals.

#### Pricing Desk

Join us for the second stop on the mortgage journey! The Pricing Desk works diligently every day to maximize profit while minimizing risk. They are responsible for determining the rates for our products. After this e-learning you will understand the tools, roles, and great work this team does to help us be engineered to amaze.

#### Creative Marketing

Ever wonder who comes up with our awesome Rocket Mortgage and Buy In commercials? Have you seen our unique direct mail sent to clients and wanted to know more? Learn how our marketing team increases brand awareness and generates leads by driving clients to our products.

#### Lead Allocation

The marketing team does more than just creating advertisements for Quicken Loans. After the marketing team generates thousands of leads, the lead allocation team makes sure we get the right lead to the right banker at the right time.

#### Foundation Banking

We have two types of bankers here at Quicken Loans. Before a banker can talk to clients about products they need to be licensed. While they are studying for their licensing tests they are called Foundation or Associate Bankers. In this e-learning, you will learn about the responsibilities and tools that help our Associate Bankers get ready for the banking floor.

#### Mortgage Banking

We have two types of bankers here at Quicken Loans. After our Bankers graduate from The Foundation they become Licensed Mortgage Bankers, or Web Bankers who talk to clients about products. Bankers build relationships with our clients to help them find a product that meets their emotional and financial goals. In this module, you will learn about the tools and skills our Bankers need to be engineered to amaze.

#### Folder Receive

Did you know that before any loan can move to the Operations teams it must be cleared through the Folder Receive team? Learn why this team is critical to the success of the mortgage journey that helps keep us moving at the speed of Quicken.

#### Client Care Specialists (CCS) / Senior Purchase Specialist (SPS)

A part of our “secret sauce” here at Quicken Loans is specialization. Client Care Specialists and Senior Purchase Specialists are the clients’ single point of contact while the loan is in Operations. This e-learning will teach you about the essential roles our CCSs and SPSs play in the mortgage journey and how they act as a go between our clients and Operations team members.

#### Underwriting

In this e-learning, you will learn how essential our underwriting team members are to ensure the success of Quicken Loans and clients’ mortgage journey. We have various types of underwriters in Operations who review the documentation necessary to ensure state and federal guidelines are met and our clients are able to move into their dream home.

#### Vendor

Specialization is just one of the ways Quicken Loans is engineered to Amaze. We know that qualifying for a mortgage requires lots and LOTS of documentation. Collecting that much paperwork can be taxing on our clients. This is where the Vendor team comes in, they work to collect documents from third parties required for our clients to close and move into their dream home.

#### Closing

Moving a loan to closing is the time for the client to celebrate getting their dream home! Closing Care Representatives help clients and their agents navigate the final step in the mortgage journey. They coordinate a notary, get the final paperwork sent out, and make sure our client’s original goals are still being met.

#### Servicing

Did you know that at Quicken Loans we service 95% of the loans that we originate? That’s awesome! And means that most of our clients will interact with our Servicing team members. These team members collect payments and disperse escrow for our clients. This e-learning will teach you about the many ways that servicing lives their promise to clients of “love, protect, amaze.”

To help our teams deliver that JD Power award winning service we utilize four major software systems. These technology tools are used by team members in various areas of the business to wow our clients every day. Join us as we take a step behind the scenes and learn more.

* * *

## Phase 3: Technology

#### GURU (Guideline Underwriting Reference Utility)

Do you know where to go to find information about all the amazing products we offer?   This eLearning provides an outline for GURU, a one of a kind tool created by the Product Lab in Capital Markets that uses Google search analytics, for our team members to get all the product details we may need.

#### LOLA (Loan Origination Lead Allocation)

Did you know we receive over half a million leads each month?  LOLA is a tool that we created to help our leads get to the right banker at the right time. In this training you will learn how bankers are able to talk to clients and help them find the right product.

#### AMP (Amazing Mortgage Platform)

AMP stands for Amazing Mortgage Platform.  In this eLearning you will discover how this tool helps our Operations team to underwrite and  process the next most closeable loan.

#### MSP (Mortgage Services Platform)

Our amazing service doesn’t end with origination.  MSP is the tool that our servicing team uses to continue to provide an awesome experience to love, protect, and amaze our clients.
