## Discussion items

Nathan Rabe: UXL Office Hours



White space vs. content



Tailor app to audience



Team member focused:

- IDEs (lots of info)
- Code bases / GIT repos / Coloring / HAL
- Fit into existing ecosystem
- RED/GREEN - Tests passing failing
- Stick with things they already know




Figure out what they need to do &gt; Process



List out tasks / actions (prioritized)



Servers up/down &gt; Now what?



Figure out what the goals are &gt; Next steps / Informational &gt; Links / Help



UV/Guerrilla testing : Mock ups for feedback : Wireframes / photoshop



Usable vs comprehensive



Accessibility: Tabs/ordering (pic ALTs) : Screen readers?



Color blindness : iconify in addition to color: Wording / Arrows (Up/Down)



Tend to NOT use a legend - it should be intuitive with existing icons / words - with badges/buttons colored



Navigation / breadcrumbs



Keyboard accessibility (not just mouse)



User testing (UV) : 
 - People who aren’t familiar with app

- Target audience
- Team members vs. leaders




Thresholds : Goals to achieve vs. current status



Visual Styling Library: SPARK : [https://sparkdesignsystem.github.io/spark-design-system/](https://sparkdesignsystem.github.io/spark-design-system/)

- Dave Gilhespy




Tooltips / Inline help better than FAQ - popups that also report status



Drill-down into more data



Expandable content



Ask during UV testing: What does this mean / Does it make sense / Did you find the info useful / Did you know how to find it?



[i] - more info



Amount of info vs. goals of info (balanced) - present what the users care about



Time series needed vs . Goals



Define what success looks like



Look at the app &gt; understand what it does &gt; Does it solve your question?



What are you trying to solve? &gt; Does this solve it for you?



Questions for Usability:

[https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)





Test with a handful of people : Find patterns : Get feedback + iterate



Ask what problems did you need insight into - Does the app solve those issues?



Throw prototypes away - just get stuff understood (not necessarily working perfectly)



What the audience wants / sparse versus dense/lots of content



Levels of detail (drill down for more)



Dashboard vs. diagnostic tool (link) (At a glance versus pore over detail)



Figure out success looks like (TMs look at it once a week, etc.)



Data polling / vs how often updated
