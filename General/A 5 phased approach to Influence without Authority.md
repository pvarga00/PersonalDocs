(Stolen blatantly from Nishant Gupta! Great content!)


As an architect I need to drive architectural efforts spanning several teams, most of which are beyond my direct control. One of the most frequent challenges I run into is "how do I influence people and get things done on time"? 

On more than one occasion, team members have asked me if I have a strategy to deal with it. So here is a 5 phased approach practical strategy that I use and recommend to influence without authority.

# Build Trust

If you don't build trust with your partners really a team: it's just a group of individuals, working together, often making disappointing progress. They may not share information with you, and they may not cooperate with you to do the right things. It doesn't matter how capable or talented your people are, but if trust is not there either you or your partners may never reach their full potential.

However, when trust is in place, both you and your partners become stronger because he or she is part of an effective, cohesive group. When people trust one another, the group can achieve truly meaningful goals.

If you want to build trust with you and your partners, then lead by example and show your partners that you trust them. **Communicate openly** to your partners. Open communication is essential for building trust. You need to get everyone on the same page by talking to one another in an honest, meaningful way. Build Relationship with your partners, spend some time to know them. We have lots of remote team member in our technology teams, don't just chat to them through email or give them a call sometimes, take them out to lunch when they are onsite.


# Motivate

As you are building Trust with your partners, Next step would be to motivate team member/partners.
The easiest way to motivate without sounding like a philosopher is to gather and publish Data or Statistics (KPIs/Metrics) for the motivational factors that you want to use.  The key is to find the right motivational factors that are appropriate for the situation and the people you want to influence. Always know your audience. Some of the things you can use are Customer Impact; team member impact; Financial impact on the company; Impact on team's performance, morale, and operational burden; Possible career growth for the team member.

Just remember always use the right things for the right reasons.

# Persuade

Once you have built the Trust and motivated the team member/partners. Now is the time to start the power of persuasion.
Out of sight is out of mind, so keep interacting with the individuals that you want to influence and keep reiterating what needs to be done. To ensure that you don’t sound over-assertive, get the partners you are interacting with to agree upon a regular cadence at which you will interact with them to seek and share information or updates these could be weekly status email or as frequent as a daily standup. 

Sometimes if you feel your message is not getting through Repeat, Repeat and Repeat. Keep this in mind when you set out to deliver a message whose goal is to persuade. Make a point of repeating your message at different intervals, through different mediums. Familiarity, it seems, breeds acceptance.

Try to be omnipresent, at least for the people who you want to influence. Constantly interacting with the people you want to influence will also help you understand the challenges they are facing, and identify areas that you could help them with. You might feel that it's not your job or responsibility to understand and resolve their challenges, but believe me, this will go a long way in building the relationship and establishing trust.

# Negotiate

Now as you have to Build Trust, motivated your partners, persuaded them for  your requirements. You probably know you can not always get what you want. For Example: Sometimes teams can't go for a perfect highly scalable and reliable architecture as the timeline is near and we need to get this feature in front of our clients. In those cases, You have to negotiate, always be ready for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for our requirements. 
Be open minded, Help people understand the Why behind your requirements and also seek to understand their situations. 
This is the time you can use that you have invested in building trust.  Learn from the people you want to influence on what motivates them and then negotiate with them accordingly.

# Help Other Team Members
One of the easiest ways to help others is to simply share your knowledge. You don’t have to be in front of a classroom to teach. Every day there is an opportunity to educate someone about your area of expertise. Give personal attention to team member and partners, don't throw stuff over the wall. The key is to keep educating yourself so you can stay ahead of the curve. Always, make an effort to ask a team member where they need help, and keep that in mind when you see an opportunity. Another way to help team member is to give honest feedback ([Radical Candor](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)) without any bullsh!t, and also work with them on the action items on their opportunity. If you just tell them about the opportunity and don't work with them to overcome, then you are not helping.
