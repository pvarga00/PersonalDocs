**Subj:** Read-Only: iDash Presentation [Meeting Summary Recap]

Greetings QAPOW Team Members!

Today I presented on the iDash application : what it is, how it works, and why it is important to QL.



Here are some of the things we covered:

- High level overview of iDash
    - Problem Statement: What we are solving
    - Why iDash is important to QL: Visibility
    - How we are solving the problem: POC Technology + Strategy
        - History: Node + JS
        - Current: .NET Core MVC App
        - API driven for flexibility / extensibility
- Desired Metrics to Track: Why we chose each metric & an explanation of each
- Demo of the application (Clicking through the features)
- Next Steps / Future of iDash:
    - Turning the POC into a real application
        - Partnering with BI to host
        - Investigating new technologies for "real application" (InfluxDB + Grafana, etc.)
        - Implementing even more metrics tracking




I really appreciated your attendance and passion for the iDash application!
