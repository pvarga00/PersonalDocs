# Leadership Guidance

## Top 3 Focus Concerns for a Leader
1. Happy (indivdual) Team Members
2. Happy Team (together!)
3. Whole Happy Team Executes on Core Capabilities/Initiatives (the Work!)
4. Provide Visibility & Summary of the VALUE delivered

... everything else is gravy (not your core capability!)

**NOTE: If you have a happy team focused on the work - and NOT focused on negative feelings instead -- Then you've got an awesome team!! :)
Solve problems in the above order (it'll hopefully be more effective later on)
