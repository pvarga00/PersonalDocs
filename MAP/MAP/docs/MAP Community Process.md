Since technology has been moving towards a cross-functional setup for its teams it has become more and more difficult for leaders to know all of the intricacies of the myriad&nbsp;of roles and responsibilities that exist. One attempt to solve this has been&nbsp;<ac:link><ri:space ri:space-key="TRAC"></ri:space><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[TRAC Career Guides]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link>, which has helped to document the roles and responsibilities for several titles at QL (and adding more by the day). MAP now covers principal engineer and other expert-level roles in IT.</p><p>MAP bridges the gap between TRAC documentation and standards and the team members who are ready (or possibly on the pathway) to reach the next level. MAP consists of many architects, SMEs, leaders, and other experts at QL who are obsessed with helping our team members continue to advance beyond senior engineer.</p><p>Our goal is to&nbsp;<strong>grow</strong>&nbsp;team members into their next role, not to&nbsp;<strong>prevent</strong>&nbsp;them from moving forward. We do that by standardizing expectations across the company and setting clear goals and guidelines. There can be a large disconnect between the perceived expectations of an architect or expert engineer and the actual expectations. We attempt to educate team members on these differences in a hope of clarifying what their role would entail. This way when they level-up they have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, as well as their leader knowing that they can hold them accountable to these expectations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h2>The MAP Process</h2><h3>MAP Community&nbsp;</h3><p>The MAP community containing 1-2 drivers from each <strong>stream</strong> will own MAP for their stream and ensure <strong>alignment</strong> between streams.&nbsp; The community will be responsible for updating the process and strategy of our Engineering MAP and TRAC.&nbsp; Engineering Experience will shepherd the community, participate as a member, and support rollout to each stream.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3>MAP Process (Per Stream)</h3><p>Each stream is responsible for running their MAP process, including building a group with-in the stream to do the assessments, mentoring and helping the MAP community.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mentoring and peer review are expectations of Staff and Principle engineers.&nbsp; As the community grows the Staff engineers will be expected to drive the MAP process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="gliffy" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="3d8a3a14-b987-4050-8c8e-09c03453232d"><ac:parameter ac:name="size">1200</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="name">RT MAP Process</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="pagePin">7</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name=""></ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h1>1.&nbsp;Understand Responsibilities</h1><table class="relative-table wrapped" style="width: 73.3378%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 31.3975%;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1"><span>Engineering Roles</span></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p><strong>Staff</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>title is for the following roles:</span></p><ul><li>Software Engineer</li><li>Software Engineer in Test</li><li>Web UI Engineer</li><li>Database Engineer</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Moving forward we hope to be able to bring more roles into MAP throughout QL Technology.</p><p><br></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h1>2.

Receive Feedback</h1><p>Feedback is captured by the MAP group in private Confluence (this may change) pages. We include feedback in the same style format as TRAC has defined competencies (using a scale of 0-3). We also provide&nbsp;<strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<strong>Action Plan</strong>&nbsp;that the team member should focus on to continue their growth.</p><p>After the panel interview, each individual panel member's feedback is entered into the private&nbsp;<strong>Candidate Feedback</strong>, for each of the category sections. Once all of the feedback is gathered, a secondary meeting is conducted by the original panel to discuss feedback and assign rating evaluations. If there are any discrepancies, the group outliers discuss their reasoning for the rating, and the group mutually agrees upon the evaluated rating, for each category.</p><p>Once all feedback has come to a consensus, and the category ratings are completed, an overall candidate rating will be determined by the MAP panel:</p><table class="wrapped"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><span class="status-macro aui-lozenge aui-lozenge-success">READY</span></td><td>The team member is ready, and has proven their abilities and knowledge, and can be trusted with the new role and responsibilities.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="status-macro aui-lozenge aui-lozenge-current">ON THE CUSP</span></td><td>The team member is nearly ready, but there's something holding them back.

The MAP coordinator will meet with the candidate's leader for 3<strong>0 minutes</strong>. We want to make sure that our evaluation is clear, concise, and in line with the leader's experiences with the team member. At this time the leader may provide additional feedback to MAP or bring attention to any additional concerns they have.</p><h5>Visibility of the feedback itself is limited to the MAP assessment group plus the team member's leader.</h5><h3>Sharing feedback with the candidate</h3><p>After the feedback is finalized and the MAP Coordinator and the TL are aligned on the decision, a&nbsp;<strong>brief 15 minute</strong>&nbsp;meeting will be scheduled with the TM. This meeting includes an MAP coordinator, the candidate's Team Leader, the Candidate, and a mentor (if one is to be assigned).&nbsp;The decision will be shared with the candidate as well as next steps in the process.</p><p>At this time, read access to the full feedback will be opened to the candidate. If the candidate has further questions on the feedback, they can contact the MAP coordinator, or individual MAP members from their assessment group. We are completely open to going further in-depth on feedback to help the candidate understand and grow their skill level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-warning" title="(warning)" src="https://confluence/s/en_GB/7202/e97769bbf919c0bd667762fc102f557beacb7f94/_/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png" alt="(warning)" border="0">&nbsp;Please Note: Not all candidates may receive a mentor, especially candidates who are &quot;Not Yet&quot; ready. A candidate who has been designated &quot;Not Yet,&quot; but still wishes to continue learning and pursuing the MAP program, may want to consider creating an action plan to address identified areas for opportunity, following a similar process to &ldquo;On-The-Cusp&rdquo; candidates. Even though no MAP mentor may be assigned, it is highly suggested that they seek additional mentoring, working on an action plan to address areas of opportunity, and document those achievements into their portfolio. This can be a living document that will be preparation for the next evaluation time.</p><p><br></p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h1>6.

The mentor's primary duty is to provide clarity of expectations, find opportunities for the candidate, and help them in any way they can.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="info" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="637e1bad-fd86-4a48-89c2-5a4d71e2c756"><ac:rich-text-body><p>The candidate may choose to stop the mentorship at any time.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>They may decide this is not the path they want, or that they aren't yet ready to take on new responsibilities. Likewise, the mentor may stop the mentorship if they find the candidate is not taking it seriously or showing consistent progress.</p><p>It is perfectly fine for a candidate to stop the MAP process at any time. There is no obligation or pressure to continue as there are many reasons candidates may desire or not be able to continue the process. Driving towards the next level of your career is <strong>hard work and can be time consuming</strong>. MAP tries to be conscious of work-life balance as well as each individual candidate's unique circumstance. This is why we let the candidates drive the process and whenever they are ready to proceed to the next step MAP is here for them.</p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section></ac:layout>
