We're looking for engineers and architects with experience and those that have proven they can consistently deliver quality software and technical leadership. Not everyone in the candidate's MAP assessment group will have a familiarity with the candidate. In addition, some people get nervous and may forget their accomplishments or we may not get to cover all the topics we wanted to. This submitted document allows the candidate to take their time and document their achievements.</p><p>This portfolio should document the candidate's proudest moments and milestones here at Quicken Loans. What are their accomplishments? Which projects did they lead?</p><p>But also what were their failures, what did they learn? Understanding our failures and learning from them is just as important. This is the candidates chance to put their best foot forward and speak directly to their assessment group at their own pace.</p><p>We are also looking for unique details about these accomplishments, and why you think that the work and projects embodied in your portfolio reflects your ability to perform at the Principal or Architect level. Please be sure to specifically highlight any design or architectural patterns you've implemented (and why), key aspects showing maintainable/robust code, and any difficult scenarios that you've solved in an elegant manner.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h2>About the candidate</h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">My name is Dwight Schrute, a senior engineer on the <strong>Business Development Synergy Management</strong> team. I joined Quicken Loans in 2011 as a software engineer. Since joining QL I've focused mostly on backend technologies and languages by building applications and APIs for our division. I have significant experience with Ruby, Java, and Scala. Before joining QL I used Ruby for most projects and have about 7 years of experience with it. Currently, I use Scala for most of my projects at QL.</span></p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h2>Code</h2><p>Codebases and projects I have contributed to.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/rare-puppers">https://github.com/s/ample/rare-puppers</a>&nbsp;(Application)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/dank-memes">https://github.com/s/ample/dank-memes</a>&nbsp;(Application)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/challenge">https://github.com/s/ample/challenge</a>&nbsp;(Project - for Initiative Z)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/ruby-lib">https://github.com/s/ample/ruby-lib</a>&nbsp;(Open sourced ruby library)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/scala-lib-1">https://github.com/s/ample/scala-lib-1</a>&nbsp;(Scala library - for Service X)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/s/ample/project-i">https://github.com/s/ample/project-i</a>&nbsp;(Application)</li></ul><h2>Documentation</h2><p>Documentation, diagrams, and architecture descriptions.</p><ul><li><a href="http://confluence/x/abcd">http://confluence/x/abcd</a>&nbsp;(Space for Initiative Z)</li><li><a href="http://confluence/x/efgh">http://confluence/x/efgh</a>&nbsp;(Documentation for Service X)</li><li><a href="http://confluence/x/ijkl">http://confluence/x/ijkl</a>&nbsp;(Architecture diagrams for Project I)</li><li><a href="http://confluence/x/mnop">http://confluence/x/mnop</a>&nbsp;(Virtual Team E documentation and progress)</li></ul></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><h2>Portfolio</h2><table class="wrapped"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1">Date</th><th>Project</th><th>Summary</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1">2016</td><td colspan="1">Project I</td><td colspan="1"><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Joined <strong>Project I</strong> to develop a landing site to handle load from the company advertising during the Puppy Bowl.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">This was a small team that needed to work quickly to get up and running in 2 months, including completing acceptance, performance and security testing.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Lead engineering and worked closely with architect P.
