# General Interview Guidance & Tips:

- Set the tone for the interview: try to be relaxed, inquisitive, approachable, pleasant, and friendly
- State that this panel is here to not only evaluate the candidate's proficiency, bring clarity to the expectations in the position - but also to help the candidate be successful in BEING an architect.
    - We will team the candidate up with a mentor, and we'll help the candidate grow within / into the position
- Ask the architect candidate a few "ice breaker" questions, to set the candidate at ease (please be careful!)
- Give a brief background on yourself and your experience at the architect position within the company
- Give a brief overview of the company itself (if candidate is external to QL)
- Review the candidate’s work history : gently probe the candidate as to why they are being considered for the role / why they want the role
- Try to get a feel for the candidate’s personality and fit into our architect culture
    - This could potentially be a future team member!


# Behavioral Considerations of the Candidate:

- Motivation / Defining Goals: Why Architecture?
- Continual Improvement & Initiative: Commitment to Self / Team (Mentoring)
- Problem Solving & Perseverance
- Technical Acumen


## General Aptitude Questions (Motivation / Defining Goals)

- Define what "being a Architect" means to you (look for words like: high-level / high-impact / integrations / deep vs. wide / enterprise / solutions /
- Do you know what will be expected of you in this role?
- Why are you looking for a new opportunity as a Architect?
- What value do you think that you can provide in this role? To whom? (Ask the candidate to think about all of the different levels/various "clients" that they will be supporting / look for their take on "business value" versus "qualities of service value")
    - What business value do you think you can bring to our delivery teams specifically?
- What have you done when you've seen processes, tools, events or situations in any of your prior environments -- where you knew there was a better way to do something?
- "Sell the concept of quality" to a project team - how would you go about it (show the value)


## Work Environment Expectations (Motivation / Defining Goals)

- Describe a "typical" situation from your current position where you "stepped up" and performed as an architect role (giving several examples of already performing at the level, shows to us that you can potentially perform and excel at this role in the future when you are given the position)
- What don’t you like in your current work environment? What have you done to improve / resolve / mitigate the situation?
- Explain what you think a typical day for an architect would look like? (Please don't say: "it's ONLY meetings, right?")
- Detail your dream work environment within this role (level setting expectations, with reality)
- What do you think are your next steps once you've mastered this role?
- Describe what you would want to do / accomplish within the first week / month / year within the architect role


## Personality / Learning / Initiative: Self (Continuous Improvement)

- What attributes does a <u>GREAT</u> Architect possess?
- How do you stay current in the industry? How have you used, disseminated and shared, and implemented on those initiatives?
- Have you ever failed (miserably)? How did you overcome it? What did you learn from it?
- Tell me something about a project which has recently challenged you
- What's your strategy for being stuck on a problem?
- Interpersonal Relationships: [DIFFICULT SCENARIO NEEDED]


## Mentoring: Team Members / Leaders (Continuous Improvement)

- How have you mentored/influenced your fellow team members? (junior / peer / senior to candidate)
- How do you think that you have been influential in having Leadership adopt/enact a change for quality?
- Have you ever been <u>unsuccessful</u> in attempting to mentor / influence others? What happened?
- How have you been involved in the engineering/quality-focused communities? (meet-ups, internal sessions, leading, knowledge sharing)




## Technology (Technical Acumen) ([These questions will differ / is highly dependent upon the individual](https://confluence/display/QAPOW/Interviewing+a+Quality+Architect))

- Describe your "Perfect System" : Delivery process / concepts: Source Control / Branching Strategies, Continuous Integration, All levels of Automated Testing (per level), Continuous Deployment, etc.
    - Example: For a web-front end, .NET middleware, and a database (SQL) backend :: In broad strokes, how would you architect the system
- Explain the situation / opportunity which presented itself to you to become the expert in a technology/application? What made you passionate about it?
- Have you ever been in a situation where you've had a new technology/application and only had 2 weeks to learn it? What happened?
- Explain the difference between a system that is Fragile, Robust, Anti-fragile/Self-Healing
- Explain your approach to deciding the toolset to use for the automation of an application
    - Costing, support, maintainability, usability, speed, extensibility, load, etc
- Explain how a dedicated suite of tools (offered by a single vendor) compares **AND** contrasts to "many different tools, each performing a specific function, in concert"
- Explain the non-functional requirements for a system - and their impact to the business / clients:
    - Quality attributes such as: fault-tolerance, backward compatibility, reusability, extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability, and other such "–ilities."
        - Stakeholder concerns often translate into requirements on these "quality of service" attributes, (also called: non-functional requirements, extra-functional requirements, behavioral requirements, or quality attribute requirements)
    - How do you ENSURE that these are being met? (measurable!)
- Explain how you would research and implement enterprise-level tools and processes (static/dynamic code analysis, CI, quality gates, BDD/ATDD, etc.)
- How have you ensured data consistency / quality throughout your systems/needs - and why?
- Which technologies are you most familiar with? (.NET / Open Source, etc.) - which do you prefer and why?
- Explain some ways in which you would help / provide recommendations in order to reduce a team's technical debt




## Communication (Problem Solving & Perseverance)

- Conflict Resolution/Mitigation
- Commitment to "Win-Win" or best possible solutioning
- Written + Verbal + Awareness of physiological messaging


## 
Analysis (Problem Solving & Perseverance)

- Competing goals/priorities
- Constraints: Resource, Time, Technical, Quality, Cost




## Things To Be Cognizant Of (As An Architect)

- Do not try to solve issues in a vacuum. Push for collaboration after a proof of concept. You want to ensure adoption, so choose the appropriate messaging (marketing) and have an on-boarding/training plan for your initiatives. Sell the concept(s)/idea(s)! Make your solutions seems like a "no-brainer" -- as you've shown the VALUE.
- Possess a grander/wider vision. Step outside of the current problem that you are solving, and think holistically of the solution, in order to solve the scenario the best you can, for the "greater good / number of constituents". Always try to think if your solutions can be applied to other situations, teams, and on a wider scale. Make sure that the solutions you are proposing truly solve the problem, and in the best manner you can, within the given constraints (time, resources, cost, maintainability, robustness, etc.).
- Focus + Priority : You will have to manage how to best solve issues against your schedule, priorities, and other team needs. This is a high-wire balancing act. You will miss meetings, for other more important ones. So stay connected. Collaborate. Be aware of other business areas and teams, and what they are doing, and how. See how the entire enterprise is interconnected, and how each supports one another. Leverage opportunities for synergies, efficiencies, and continuous improvements. Help to make everyone a little bit better, everyday.


## Wrap-Up

- Do you have any questions for us? (Note: Do not accept: "No" as an answer - They **should** have **some** questions)
