# **What is a Staff Engineer**



**Staff engineers** are the engineering lead of significant projects. These engineers have perfected their craft in their chosen domain.

Staff engineers spend a **non-trivial** amount of time mentoring and **effectively** improving the knowledge and productivity of others in their **development group**.

Staff engineers are actively involved in architecture, engineering, and process improvements as well as implementing those changes across multiple teams. They will be the primary expert for multiple systems and an effective contact for any issue or troubleshooting for systems in their development group.



**Staffs** are expected to:

- Be experts in their role
- Capable of venturing outside of their role and perform duties of **some** other roles (within engineering) to a **limited** degree (equivalent to entry-level)


1. **Influence**:                  Domain
2. **Experience**:               7+ years
3. **Distribution**:             5%
4. **disciplines**:                Software, System, Web UI, and Database

# Assessment Process

## **Assessment Driver Steps**

1. **Interview driver have alignment with stream leader to move forward with the Staff assessment.**
2. **Ask Engineer to turn on GitHub Analytics so peers can see were team member spends time and contributions**
    1. **<ac:image ac:height="250"><ri:attachment ri:filename="image2019-10-8_14-26-18.png"></ri:attachment></ac:image>**
3. **Setup the page in confluence to leave feedback**
    1. Request Access to the "Map Drivers" group through [MyAccess](https://myaccess.rockfin.com/myaccess/accessRequest/accessRequest.jsf#/accessRequest/selectUser?quickLink=Request%20Access)
    2. Copy the <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="0000-00-00 Feedback Template"></ri:page><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[template]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link>
        1. Update the Name *"Date - Candidate"*
        2. Make the new page private and add the**peer group**
    3. The Interview driver update the template to include the candidates portfolio, github enterprise, github public links
4. **(Optional) Use stream peer review of submitted materials to determine if should move forward to peer assessment**
5. **Peer assessment**

    1. Schedule peer assessment meeting for 90 minutes
    2. Set **expectations** for **peers** to review the following before the meeting - **Peers** do a review prior to the meeting. 
        1. Peer Review of Submitted Materials 
            1. TRAC
            2. Why letter
            3. Portfolio
        2. Peer should Review Code in GitHub - Go deep into a variety of commits
            1. Compare contributions with other Staffs Engineers/Senior Engineers
        3. Review Public GitHub
    3. **After** Assessment set expectation that peers should leave there comments prior to the regrouping
6. **Setup the meeting to consolidate feedback and put a grade to each section.  This meeting will require at least**60**minutes**
    1. Review individual comments and add agreed upon comments from the group in the Rubric
    2. Score the rubric
    3. Review and document strengths
    4. Review and document growth opportunities
    5. Discuss opportunities and ideal mentors/area of growth
    6. Peer group agreement on if team member is not ready, on the cusp, or ready
7. **Deliver Results**
    1. Review peer assessment with Stream leader
    2. Setup feedback session with team member


## **Peer Group**

**The Peer group should be made up of Engineers from the Stream and 2 Engineers from other streams for alignment.   As a Staff Engineer or Principle Engineer being part of peer group is part of that team members job description.**

**<ac:structured-macro ac:name="status" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="5bc5d1e0-8bbe-437a-a204-a7eebf016323"><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="title">Important</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>**Staff Engineers are the top engineers at the company.   Staff Engineers will spend a significant amount of time writing code, doing code reviews, and creating pull requests.

The Peer group will need to spend a non-trivial amount of time during the process researching the team members contributions and providing feedback.

Review the following items during the assessment period:

- Review Submitted Materials
- Review Code in GitHub - Go deep into a variety of commits
- Review Public GitHub
