This space is dedicated to providing guidance on conducting the architectural role assessment panel, (by role type).



In an effort to standardize our AMAP interview process, below is an outline of topics and sub-points to be addressed during an assessment. While the questions themselves are contextual and at the discretion of the panel interviewer(s), feedback for each topic is required.



Addendum: These guidelines are provided for <u><strong>guidance</strong></u> within an interview, and are not intended to be used as a verbatim playbook, asking each question line-by-line.

The content herein are provided more for a "general flow"/awareness, as questions have been repeated in differing ways to allow you to tailor to your interview to the candidate and/or yourself.

Please be aware the general categories of discussion topics / areas of concern, but do not use the information in this space explicitly.



# Architect Assessments - General Guidance & Tips:

- Prior to the interview, feel free to ask the architect candidate a few non-technical/personal "ice breaker" questions, to set the candidate at ease
- Set the tone for the interview: try to be relaxed, inquisitive, approachable, pleasant, and friendly
- Set expectations: 
    - We **want** the candidates to be an architect, we're trying to get an idea of where they are in terms of skills, knowledge, career path - and devise a plan on how to get the candidate there (candidates are not on trial - we **are** helping and facilitating their growth into the role)
    - State that this panel is here to not only evaluate the candidate's proficiency, bring clarity to the expectations in the position - also helping the candidate to be successful in BEING an architect
    - We will team the candidate up with a mentor, who will help the candidate grow within or into the position
- Give a brief overview of the company itself (if candidate is external to QL)
- Give a brief background on (interviewers/yourselves) and your experience within the architect position within the company
- Review the candidate’s work history : gently probe the candidate as to why they are being considered for the role / why they want the role
- Try to get a feel for the candidate’s personality and fit into our **architect culture**
    - This could potentially be a future architect team member!
- Meeting Cadence: Overview &gt; About architect role &gt; About the candidate &gt; Questions from the candidate &gt; Next steps
    - We evaluate viability for the role of architect, the panel does not award the title, but we do propose the evaluation to the candidate's leader
- Highly Suggested: At least ~2 team leaders present for external candidates / ~1+ for internal candidates


# Behavioral Considerations of the Candidate (try to be aware of these throughout the interview):

- Motivation / Defining Goals: Why Architecture?
- Continual Improvement & Initiative: Commitment to Self / Team (Mentoring)
- Problem Solving & Perseverance
- Presence: Command the room, clear/concise communication, convey/command leadership
- Technical Acumen
- Non-verbal Cues: Body language, posture, active listening, eye contact, general awareness (inclusive engagement of the entire room/phone)
- Thought / analysis patterns / ability to think (pause, think, act/do)
- Follow through/up with the group: thank you, handshakes, follow-on emails (polished business acumen)

    Evaluation of candidate's answer to questions:

    - (Example) : "Sell the concept of &lt;**<u><em>INSERT ARCHITECT TOPIC/TOOLING/PROJECT HERE</em></u>**&gt;" to a project team, leadership, etc. - how would you go about it (show the value)"?
    - What we're looking for:

        - Marketing, evangelism of "recommended practices", thought processes, communication (can they tell a compelling story)
        - Candidate can point out strengths/weaknesses/alternatives/limitations to their solutions/processes
        - Elasticity/scalability/maintainability/holistic overall view of the solution, and why this one is the "best" one for this scenario
        - Passion + Expertise + Commitment

    
    Try to ask guided open ended questions - this allows a candidate to show how they think:

    - Ask for / advise candidate to lead the group through a thought process
    - Look for concrete examples/practice over theory/concepts
        - Example: Candidates may not know the actual name of various design patterns, but knowing how they are applied and work best for a given scenario, which is the critical take-away


## General Aptitude Questions (Motivation / Defining Goals)

- Motivation / Defining Goals:
    - Ask the candidate to define what "being a Architect" means to you (look for words like: high-level / high-impact / integrations / deep vs. wide / enterprise / solutions)
    - Do you know what will be expected of you in this role?
    - Why are you looking for a new opportunity as a Architect?
- Value Add: 
    - What value do you think that you can provide in this role? To whom? (Ask the candidate to think about all of the different levels/various "clients" that they will be supporting / look for their take on "business value" versus "qualities of service value")
    - What business value do you think you can bring to our delivery teams specifically?
    - What in the last 6 months have you done / can prove that you're already succeeding in the architect role?

    - Describe a past situation where you personally were motivated to implement a solution to a problem that you wanted changed
    - Describe a typical situation from your current position where you "stepped up" and performed as an architect role (giving several examples of already performing at the level, showing to us that you can potentially perform and excel at this role in the future when you are given the position)
    - What don’t you like in your current work environment? What have you done to improve / resolve / mitigate the situation?
- Level Setting Expectations about the Architect Role:
    - Explain what you think a typical day for an architect would look like? (Please don't say: "it's ONLY meetings, right?")
    - Detail your dream work environment within this role (level setting expectations, with reality)
    - What do you think are your next steps once you've mastered this role?
    - Describe what you would want to do / accomplish within the first week / month / year within the architect role

- Describe your "Perfect System" : Delivery process / concepts: Source Control / Branching Strategies, Continuous Integration, All levels of Automated Testing (per level), Continuous Deployment, etc.
    - Example: For a web-front end, .NET middleware, and a database (SQL) backend :: In broad strokes, how would you architect a strategy for this scenario? Which pieces would you try to automate, and why/why not?
- Explain the situation / opportunity which presented itself to you to become the expert in a technology/application? What made you passionate about it?

## Communication (Problem Solving & Perseverance)

- Conflict Resolution/Mitigation
    - Tell us a situation where you were able to persevere, and handle a difficult scenario where you resolved a conflict


## 
Analysis (Problem Solving & Perseverance)

- Competing goals/priorities: 
    - (Example): Tell us a time when you had to figure out what *thing* to work on, when you had multiple, competing priorities.
- Constraints: Resource, Time, Technical, Quality, Cost
    - (Example): Explain a situation that you were in where you were constrained by (time, quality, cost, etc.) - and how you were able to overcome/(or not all) the problem? What would you have done/learned in order to not be in that predicament again?
- Critical Thinking/Analysis: 
    - (Example): 
        - - Four people need to cross a rickety rope bridge to get back to their camp at night. Unfortunately, they only have one flashlight and it only has enough light left for seventeen minutes. The bridge is too dangerous to cross without a flashlight, and it’s only strong enough to support two people at any given time.
                Each of the campers walks at a different speed: One can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the slowest camper takes 10 minutes to cross.

                - There will need to be someone who brings back the flashlight every time.
                - It makes the most sense to have 2 people cross the bridge at a time, but only have one person bring back the flashlight
            - QUESTION: How can the campers make it across in exactly 17 minutes?

                - Example Answer:


| Step | "Initial Side" | Traveling Direction | "Other Side" | Total Elapsed Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [1m , 2m , 5m , 10m]  | N/A (initial state) | [ empty ] | 0m |
| 2 | [5m , 10m] | 2m , 1m —&gt; | [ empty ] | 2m |
| 3 | [5m , 10m] | &lt;— 1m | [2m] | 3m |
| 4 | [1m] | [5m , 10m] —&gt;   |  [2m] | 13m |
| 5 | [1m] | &lt;— 2m | [5m 10m] | 15m |
| 6 | [empty]  | 1m , 2m —&gt; | [5m 10m] | 17m |




## Things To Be Cognizant Of (As An Architect): Things to tell the candidate about the role

- Do not try to solve issues in a vacuum. Push for collaboration after a proof of concept. You want to ensure adoption, so choose the appropriate messaging (marketing) and have an on-boarding/training plan for your initiatives. Sell the concept(s)/idea(s)! Make your solutions seems like a "no-brainer" -- as you've shown the VALUE.
- Possess a grander/wider vision. Step outside of the current problem that you are solving, and think holistically of the solution, in order to solve the scenario the best you can, for the "greater good / number of constituents". Always try to think if your solutions can be applied to other situations, teams, and on a wider scale. Make sure that the solutions you are proposing truly solve the problem, and in the best manner you can, within the given constraints (time, resources, cost, maintainability, robustness, etc.).
- Focus + Priority : You will have to manage how to best solve issues against your schedule, priorities, and other team needs. This is a high-wire balancing act. You will miss meetings, for other more important ones. So stay connected. Collaborate. Be aware of other business areas and teams, and what they are doing, and how. See how the entire enterprise is interconnected, and how each supports one another. Leverage opportunities for synergies, efficiencies, and continuous improvements. Help to make everyone a little bit better, everyday.


## Wrap-Up

- Do you have any questions for us? (Note: Do not accept: "No" as an answer - They **should** have **some** questions)
