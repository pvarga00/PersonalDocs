You’ve probably heard the saying “Feedback is a Gift”. As a leader, most importantly leading yourself, it is important to have that mindset because how good we are at accepting and using feedback is greatly determined by how we view it. ACCEPTING FEEDBACK When someone gives us feedback, it is critical that we take it well. This shapes the way we are viewed and ensures that the person providing the feedback will continue to give us this useful information.

When we receive feedback, we should:

1. Leave emotion out of it. It is completely natural to feel on edge when you’re receiving feedback, but it is important to remember that feedback is not an indictment of you personally. Don’t get defensive or make excuses; be honest with yourself and own it.

2. Listen. Don’t interrupt when someone is providing you with feedback. Listen carefully and take notes.

3. Ask for clarification and examples. Once the feedback has been presented, it is okay to engage in conversation by seeking clarification and examples.

4. Thank the person giving the feedback. Giving candid feedback isn’t easy. Be sure to show sincere gratitude to the person providing you the feedback.

5. Implement the feedback into your work. Use the feedback to set goals. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, and actionable.

BEING COACHABLE Reference Guide REACTIVE VS. PROACTIVE FEEDBACK Being able to receive and accept feedback is an important part of continuing to grow and develop, but in order to receive feedback, someone needs to deliver it. Leaders and peers can provide two types of feedback: • Reactive Feedback: Feedback in response to an aspect of our performance that has occurred in the past • Proactive Feedback: Actively seeking out areas we can improve going forward Those around us may not offer regular feedback on our performance, so if we want to know how we can improve, we have to ask. Don’t wait for a leader or peer to seek you out. Studies have shown that people who ask for feedback proactively are the most effective leaders.

SEEKING OUT PROACTIVE FEEDBACK 1. Identify team members you trust. 2. Ask them to write down one thing you need to stop doing, start doing, and continue doing that would make you a more effective or successful team member. 3. Schedule a follow-up in 1-2 days to allow them time to complete this. 4. Review their feedback with them and implement it into your work
