It is ultimately in everyone's own best interest to accept responsibility for getting what they need to succeed in the work place, (rather than waiting for it to be handed to them on a plate).



To do this, ‘Self Leaders’ do the following:

1) Challenge Assumed Constraints;
2) Celebrate their points of power; and
3) Collaborate for success.



Challenge Assumed Constraints: Self Leaders do not buy into the ‘assumed constraint’ that position power is the only type of power that works.



There are 5 types of power which can be leveraged:

1) Position Power – those who have a position of formal responsibility and leadership (i.e. by employment position or title)

2) Knowledge Power – those who have a position of power because they have special or additional knowledge of a topic or issue than those around them

3) Relationship Power – those who have a position of power because of the contacts or relationships they have with other people

4) Task Power – those people who have a position of power because of their expertise or responsibility for a specific task

5) Personal Power – those people who have a position of power because of the personal relationships and trusts they have established.



Celebrate your power!

When you achieve goals it is usually because you take the initiative to get what you need to succeed. To do this it is necessary to exploit the different types of power that you have.

It is also necessary to determine your level of competence and commitment in relation to the task at hand and identify the additional direction and support that you will need to achieve the identified goal.



The concept of the ‘Needs Model’ defines four levels of competence as learners progressively become more skilled in a task. The rationale is that less skilled people need more direction and support, but as learners become more skilled, they require less direction or support, and can be relied upon to complete tasks more autonomously. Similarly people may have varying levels of commitment to completing tasks which will also require varying degrees of support.



The Needs model is shown below:

[<ac:image ac:alt="situational-leadership1" ac:class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-74" ac:height="300" ac:width="214"><ri:url ri:value="http://built101.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/situational-leadership1.jpg?w=428&amp;h=300"></ri:url></ac:image>](http://built101.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/situational-leadership1.jpg)



The four levels are:

1) D1 – Enthusiastic Beginners – they generally lack the specific skills for the job at hand however are eager to learn and willing to take direction. These people need high direction but low support. You should manage them by providing direction. You will clearly define the tasks required and follow them closely.

2) D2 – Disillusioned leaner – they may have learned some relevant skills however will not be able to do the task without some help. They may also have become disillusioned as it has dawned on them how much they do not know. These people need high direction and high support. You should manage them by providing coaching. You will still provide direction howeever seek ideas and suggestions.

3) D3 – Capable but cautious performer – they are experienced and capable however may lack the confidence to go it alone or the motivation to do it quickly or effectively. These people require low direction but high support. You should manage them by providing support. You will still facilitate decisions however delegate day to day control of tasks and provide support.

4) D4 – High Achiever – they are experienced in their job and comfortable with their own ability to perform it well. They may even be more effective than their leader. These people need low direction and low support. You should manage them by delegating. You will still be involved in decision making and problem-solving but delegate control and have the follower dictate what further engagement is required.



Collaborate for success

Self leaders collaborate to combine skill sets from others to obtain the necessary feedback, support and direction that they need to succeed.







Some Questions to Ponder as a Leader:

“I want people who are problem solvers and are willing to take the initiative.  I want people working for me who act like they own the place.”

… like empowered people …

… want honesty.

… want opportunities to constantly learn new skills.

… managers today, if they are to be effective, must think and act in different ways.

What’s the solution?  How can we help people move from a victim mind-set to flourishing as empowered problem solvers and decision makers?



<u>1. Do You Believe in Magic?</u>

… a victim of circumstance … a person who refuses to take responsibility for the situation he’s in.  It’s easier to blame everyone else around you, rather than taking responsibility for yourself.

… turn the problem upside down … so that you’re the one on top.

You are ready for self leadership when you take responsibility for your own success.

The problem with being empowered is that when things go wrong, you have no excuses.  There’s no one to blame but yourself.

Empowerment is something someone gives you.  Self leadership is what you do to make it work.



<u>2. People Are Not Mind Readers</u>

… pass on the learning to others.

Each of us has different things that motivate us.

… what motivates you today may change tomorrow.

Ultimately, it's in your own best interest to accept responsibility for getting what you need to succeed …

I need you to believe in the magic of self leadership.



<u>3. Elephant Thinking</u>

… no boss can know and provide the motivation that every individual needs.

… creating a work environment that is motivating to us.

An **‘Assumed Constraint’** is a belief you have, based on past experience, that limits your current and future experiences.

… greatest gift is to know your own mind.

How could he open their minds?



<u>4. Cycles of Power</u>

… all the negative stereotypes we have about power today …

… I feel powerless …

Because I’m not in a position to get people to do what I want them to do…

Don’t buy into the assumed constraint that position power is the only power that works.

… knowing the system … is an important point of power.

… knowledge power.

… personal power … ability to give assurance to people …

… relationship power.

… cultivating those relationships and simply asking for leads.

You don’t have to agree with everything … just take it into account.

… task power.

… position power.

“The only way in which anyone can lead you is to restore to you the belief in your own guidance.”  Henry Miller

The 5 Points of Power: Position Power, Knowledge Power, Task Power, Relationship Power, Personal Power.

You need to know the nature of your strengths – your power – before you can lead yourself.

… cultivate them. …

“The sole advantage of power is ability to do more good.”  Balthazar Gracian

**The Second Trick of Self Leadership: Celebrate Your Points of Power.**



<u>5. Diagnose Yourself</u>

Commitment is measured by your motivation and confidence about the goal.

Competence – to increase your competence to achieve a goal, you need:  Direction from someone who will:

1. set a clear goal
2. generate an action plan
3. show you how to do the goal or skill
4. clarify roles
5. provide timelines
6. establish priorities
7. monitor and evaluate your work and give feedback


Commitment – to build your commitment to achieve a goal, you need:  Support from someone who will:

1. listen to you
2. praise and encourage you
3. facilitate your problem solving
4. ask you for input
5. provide rationale (remind you why you’re doing it)
6. share information about their experiences relevant to the goal
7. share information about the organization relevant to the goal


… what to ask for at each development level.

When your competence is low, you need direction; when your commitment is low, you need support.



<u>6. Getting What You Need</u>

The Needs Model:

<u>7. Running Together</u>

You asked for help and that takes strength.  It’s hard to turn someone down who knows what they need.

When Goals work out, it is usually because you instinctively take the initiative to be a self leader and get what you need to succeed.

There is magic in diagnosing your development level and getting the direction and support you need to achieve your goal.

**The Third Trick of Self Leadership: Collaborate for Success!**



<u>8. No Excuses</u>

… leverage your partnership and come up with a plan …

… get the feedback …

The two most powerful words to collaborate for success are: “I need”.

When you use the ‘I need’ phrase, you’re coming from a position of strength.  You’ve thought about what it’s going to take to succeed and are requesting a person’s help.  It’s amazing, but human beings love to feel needed.  They love to think they can help you.  ‘I need’ is very compelling.

Don’t get derailed by disillusionment!

A leader is anyone who can give you the support and direction you need to achieve your goal.
