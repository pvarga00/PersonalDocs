# Mentorship Guidelines

## Charter

We are committed to develop and expand the skills, knowledge, and networks of our team members. We aim to provide both guidance for discovering those who wish to mentor and be mentored, pairing mentors and mentees, and supporting them in their on-going relationships. We also aim to provide mediation and oversight when issues in mentorship relationships occur.

## Mentor Rules

Mentors are teachers and counselors and coaches and friends, but they are not perfect and aren't expected to be. Here are a few rules:

- Trust and Respect your mentee
- Listen, don't just hear
- Help your mentee define and achieve goals
- Offer advice, references, resources, **constructive** feedback
- Give support when your apprentice succeeds, and when they fail
- Communicate and make sure you clearly define the skills you wish to pass on


## Mentee Rules

Mentees are learners, team members, and friends - we are not perfect and aren't expected to be. Here are a few rules:

- Take responsibility for your career goals
- Listen and share your desires, needs, and ask questions
- Incorporate feedback given, otherwise you will not grow
- Make time for interaction
- Have realistic expectations and approach the relationship with honesty


## Pairing Up

You've decided if you want to mentor or be a mentee, you've decided what skills you wish to teach or learn, and you've <ac:link><ri:page ri:space-key="QAPOW" ri:content-title="created your profile"></ri:page><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[created your profile]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> - next is the hard part:

1. Find a Partner
    1. Look for a mentee/mentor who matches in skills and availability
    2. Communicate, preferably in realtime
    3. Look for compatible personality and drive
2. Create Goals
    1. Both sides work together, this is not a one way dictation, but a collaborative discussion
    2. Goals will evolve with circumstances and time, and this will be an on-going process
    3. Goals should be specific enough to clearly define progress (SMART GOALS!)
    4. Save them, write them down, work on getting them done
3. Communicate
    1. Interaction is the key to good mentorship
    2. Online/Phone conversations are never quite as good as face-to-face, but far better than nothing
    3. Use the tech tools available
    4. No one is ever "too busy"
4. Long Term Maintenance
    1. Change your goals as you achieve them
    2. Change the nature of the relationship as your skills advance
    3. Some day you may want to change mentors, and learn from other sources, feel free to do whatever works best for your relationship
    4. Any issues with a relationship should be dealt with via mediation when things grow contentious

***<u>Questions for Kicking-Off The Relationship &nbsp;- &nbsp; Mentoring / Being a Mentee:</u>***

- Ask the most important question first: "What do you WANT?"
    - These do not necessarily need to be professional goals, but in general overall goals to be planned for, supported, and achieved
    - The "WANTS" should be [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
    - Typical time frames for obtaining goals: 6 months, 1 year, 5 year
- Think about what you want to get out of this experience (both for/from the mentor and mentee)
- What do you want more information about / help with specifically?
- What are your thoughts on:
    - Growth as a professional / career objectives
    - Passions with respect to Technologies/Skills
    - Interest in Learning Opportunities
- Speak to the "Empowerment" of the individual &gt; You need the drive/fire to "succeed"
    - The passion and diligent WORK must come from the mentee - the mentor cannot drive the direction of what the mentee seeks to learn and grow from
- Think about what will make you feel successful / How will you define the success criteria that need to be met to say that you've achieved your goals / wants?

    - Does how you defined "success" align with your objectives? Timelines?
- Roadmap Planning:
    - How do you get from here to there?
- Potential &gt; Proficiency
    - What actionable events can you do?
    - How will you measure success for yourself?
- Time / Commitment
    - Regularly scheduled meetings with mentor
    - What can you do to achieve <u style="line-height: 1.4285715;"><strong>one</strong></u> desired goal per:

        - Daily : 1 actionable achievement, that supports your overall goals - to be completed by the end of the day
        - Weekly : 5-7 cumulative, daily goals = All supporting a week end achievement
        - Monthly : 4 weekly goals = All supporting a monthly end achievement
        - Quarterly : 4 quarterly goals = All supporting a year end achievement

    ***<u>Questionnaire</u>***: Think about what you want to get out of this experience

    - What do you want more information about?
    - What are your thoughts on:
        - Growth as a professional / career objectives
        - Passions with respect to Technologies/Skills
        - Interested Learning Opportunities
    - What does it mean to be QA here at QL?


Think about what will make you feel successful

- Does how you defined “success” align with your objectives?
- Roadmap Planning:
    - How do you get from here to there?
        - Potential &gt; Proficiency
    - What actionable events can you do?
    - How will you measure success for yourself?
- Time commitment / time to completion




*<u>Stuff to think about:</u>*

- Coaches: **Push** you to do stuff     versus    Mentors: Advise you on **how** to do stuff
- Balance the advice with who is giving the message: Are they telling you something relevant? Are they an SME? Do they have a differing agenda/style to your own?
- How do I make whatever the message is "...and make it my own"? Is it even applicable and important to me?
- Different mentors have different messages / advice. Take multiple streams of input (from different mentors) and pick and choose the right path for you
- What do you want to get out of being a mentor/mentee?
- Mentee needs to have the **<u>desire</u>**in order to **improve** and **drive** the process of learning
    - Ask yourself: 
        - Do I have the desire to push myself to improve and grow in the process of learning?
        - Am I making a REAL commitment to myself?
        - Am I REALLY COMMITTED to putting in the effort to achieve my goals, on my schedule?


- Logistics:

    - Timeframe / Format of mentoring?
    - Who do I want to learn from / teach?
    - How are we going to do it? Will the process work for everyone?
        - Organic / 1-1s / Casual / Stuff I learned (experience stories) / Time-boxed?
    - Discussion Topics (proposed by both mentees + mentors)
