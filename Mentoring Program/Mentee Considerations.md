## Questions to ask yourself:

What do I **WANT**? (For my career, self, relationships, life)

Clearly define the things you want  &gt; Set goals with a reasonable "due date" to be achieved by



[GAP Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_analysis):

Do I have the skills/knowledge/things to help me achieve my goals currently?

What skills/knowledge do I want/need to support my goals?



[Roadmap / Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan):

How will I acquire the skills/knowledge/things that I'm missing?

Who can help me gain the things I need?

How will I know if I have achieved "enough" to be successful? Can I measure my progress? (Remember to celebrate any achieved supporting goals!)

How can I stay motivated?



[Goals:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal)

Set 1 daily goal - all goals should be [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

Set 1 weekly goal - make sure that your daily goals are in support of the weekly goal

Set 1 monthly goal - make sure that your weekly goals are in support of the monthly goal

Set 1 yearly goal - make sure that your monthly goals are in support of the yearly goal

Set 1 5-year goal - make sure that your yearly goals are in support of the 5-year goal

*\*\*Note: Make sure that you are continually evaluating your actions, goals, and WANTS -- to make sure that you're still doing things that support what you want to achieve -- and that you still want to commit to the work to achieve those wants.*
