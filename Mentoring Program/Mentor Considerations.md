- How can I help a new QA/developer get comfortable with an existing code base / team processes?
- For past interns, what kind of experience did they have? What was good and what was bad?
- How do we get new QA/developers experienced with "the basics"?
- Are the official intern guidelines good enough?
- What does the person want to accomplish or experience? Set up goals to make the experience worthwhile for them.
- How do we help new developers get comfortable with our culture?
- How do the ISMS apply to writing code? It’s not just about how we act.
- How do we set expectations? Time off, deliverable dates
- Identify strengths and areas for growth.
- What if I’m on a team with an intern, but am not the ‘official’ mentor. Can I still provide mentorship?
- What about rotating interns? Can we give them a chance to experience development, testing, and BA work?
- How long should it take before you can start giving the intern ‘real’ tasks for a project?
- What about mentoring junior and mid level developers? Do the same principles apply?
- What about senior developers? How do we foster the idea that everyone has areas that they can grow in? As you learn more, you realize how much more there is to learn.
- Realize that as you mentor/teach someone a topic/concept - YOU learn it better too!
