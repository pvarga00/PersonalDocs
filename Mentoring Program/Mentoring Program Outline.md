# Mission Statement

To provide guidance to both mentee's and mentor's in exploring the collaborative relationship of knowledge sharing.

# Overview

This space is dedicated to those individuals who are obsessed with helping our team members become even more AMAZING, including themselves.

&lt;MORE WORDS&gt;

This way team members (mentee and mentors, both) have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, as well as knowing that they both are accountable to these expectations. (Think: Level setting mutual understanding)

# Mentor and Mentee Preparation

Mentees: Can prepare themselves, so that they can take maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by engaging in preliminary and on-going self-directed education, relevant to the one-on-one model of learning, and so that they can increase their capacity to respond as constructive participants within mentee-mentor discussions. (Think: Pre-work of learning a little about what you're looking to learn about beforehand so that discussions are an ACTIVE collaborative chat, and not just a one-way sermon from the mentor to the mentee).

Mentors: Team members who have made the commitment to serve as mentors can refer to THEIR team leaders, and this guidance space, which should aid them in translating their good intentions into competent mentoring behaviors. Self-assessment inventories and books devoted to the subject of mentoring adult learners are integral components to honing your skills/behaviors as a mentor. [The Journey](http://www.qlequip.com/journey/) and <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Connect. Grow. Lead" ri:space-key="CFLI"></ri:page><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[CGL (Connect. Grow. Lead.) programs]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> are both worth investigating for the leadership / mentoring guidance as well.

# Meeting Guidance / Cadence

The mentee should create a meeting request (reoccurring if so desired, typical cadence: weekly or bi-monthly) within an agreed upon open time slot in the mentor's calendar.

Please be respectful of time for you both, so show up to the meeting prepared and receptive to open communication/dialogue.

You may choose to be formal or informal, as long you both are comfortable with the cadence and format for the meetings. The mentor should typically be more receptive/accommodating to the mentee's expectations/needs.

Try to choose a meeting space that is conducive to learning/collaboration, and is limited by external distractions.

Having a clear, pre-communicated (before the meeting) agenda for each meeting, leads to more focused and efficient conversations.

# Summary: Remember YOUR Responsibilities

Although mentors are considered to be primary influences on the success of the mentoring program, mentees should remember they are major contributors to the quality and value of the mentoring experience as well. The final results of the "program" – mentee career and academic progress – will ultimately depend on the mentor's knowledge, ability, and behavioral skills (and the ability to impart these to the mentee) **AND** the mentee's ability to <u>share</u> in the complex process of evolving mentor-mentee dialogue and activity, as an a enlightened <u>partner</u>.

It is in this cooperative spirit that mentees correctly make the decision to undertake the journey with a mentor. Fortunately, the great majority of mentees approach their mentors as highly important sources of guidance and support, not as miracle workers who are somehow expected to transform unwilling or resistant individuals into career or academic successes within a limited span of time.

Mentees must be prepared to function as fully engaged adult learners, given (1) the realistic limits in resources and personnel available, even in mentoring programs with ambitious agendas and conscientious staff, and (2) the appropriate expectation by mentors of sincere and noteworthy reciprocity from those selected as mentees.

The extent of the mentee's preparation, level of active involvement, and continuing efforts to improve their proficiencies as collaborative participants will ALL be CRITICAL factors in the specific relevance for them of the mentoring opportunity as a benchmark experience.

As mentees, who have been successfully mentored, also increasingly assume their own role as mentors, the mentoring model can truly become a viable option for knowledge sharing and growing our team members in an AMAZING, rich and rewarding experience.
