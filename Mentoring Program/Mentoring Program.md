**Wikipedia Defines [Mentorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship)** as:

"...a [personal developmental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development "Personal development") relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The mentor may be older or younger, but have a certain area of expertise. It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn.

The person in receipt of mentorship may be referred to as a ***protégé*** (male), a ***protégée*** (female), an [<u><span style="color: rgb(0,102,204);">apprentice</span></u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship "Apprenticeship") or, in recent years, a **mentee**.

"Mentoring" is a process that always involves communication and is relationship based, but its precise definition is elusive. One definition of the many that have been proposed, is


> Mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, [<u><span style="color: rgb(0,102,204);">social capital</span></u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital"), and the psychosocial support perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career, or professional development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the protégé)".**<u><br></u>**


..."



When we reach out a helping hand, we are both offering and receiving knowledge and experience, <u>at the same time.</u>

- The mentee gains knowledge, experience, and benefits from the guidance of the mentor...
- ... and the mentor gains knowledge and valuable insights from the process of guiding another as well.



This is a symbiotic relationship where both parties gain <u>SO MUCH</u> from the experience/partnership.
