## Who is mentoring for?
This is an informal, personal, long term, peer to peer mentorship framework/organization focused on creating networks of team members, committed to continuous improvement, from all areas within our organization.

We are all mentors and apprentices, teachers and students, coaches, counselors, and friends – all at the same time. We're committed to mentoring, working towards a common end result: a strong community of talented team members, doing some AMAZING work.

We give back to our communities as much as we take. We build each other up, learn from shared experiences... And above all, we believe in "<u>helping others to grow</u>" and enabling everyone to have the skills to be effective in learning how to "<u>pass it on</u>".

## What is Mentorship?
Mentorship is an inter-personal developmental relationship, in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.

Mentorship is more than just answering questions or providing help, it's about learning, communication, and interaction.

There are many different types of mentorships and mentorship programs. We have chosen to provide guidance and a framework for helping you to experience mentorship, without giving you strict processes/procedures to adhere to.

There are mentorship organizations/programs which have very formal procedures, and there are also much more informal/organic mentorships. Even though we have both rules for relationships and some procedures for mentorships, this space provides guidance for an informal collaboration.

Not every mentorship relationship needs to be, or should be, the kind where you invite them to your wedding, but we do focus more on personal involvement between two people, which makes our organization more personal than professional.

Although short term, intensive mentorships can be useful for specific skills. We feel that the end result of a good mentorship is a healthy career in the long term. This means our mentorships should be a rich and ever changing career-long experience.

Although group mentorships work well at the beginning of a career, we feel the best "bang for your buck" comes from a face-to-face relationship.

## When? NOW!
The idea for a mentorship organization/framework for our communities is not a new one. However several people within QL have been wanting a common place to come together with some basic rules and guidelines where people could connect with each other and get questions answered in a common way. Sometimes a little organization makes things that were previously difficult much easier. Our goal is a community where we can easily match mentors and apprentices, where we guide mentorships, and where sets of rules can help with problems.

## Where?
We communicate in various ways - from a google groups mailing list to an irc channel, wikis and example code directories on github, and our website. We also encourage face-to-face interactions: through our communities, user groups, meet-ups, conferences and other methods. We also use technology to help connect people across QL. Communication is the key to any good relationship.

## Why?
Mentoring is great for your career. 
It provides you with:
- Information - Technology moves fast, get help and insight into your every day work, and maybe how to do it even better/faster.
- Recognition - As a mentor, your apprentice's work and progress will reflect on you.
- Role modeling - As an apprentice you will have people to look to, so you can map where you want to be in the future.
- Advice - Get insights into your strengths and weaknesses, as well as guidance on where to go next.
- Networking - Find opportunities and meet people you never would have before.
- Interaction - Regular communication helps you introduce more social interaction into your work, and potentially find new and exciting solutions/opportunities.
- Intangibles - We as humans want to do things that make us feel good ... from sharing knowledge that you've received/gained previously, to helping out a new mentee find their path / achieve their goals, or just helping someone with a problem. You'll get a warm fuzzy from helping your team members out.
