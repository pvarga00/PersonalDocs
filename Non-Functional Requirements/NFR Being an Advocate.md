## Introduction

This information provides guidance on: what does it mean to be an NFR advocate, what is expected of an NFR advocate, and explain what an NFR advocate does / is responsible for.

## What does it mean to be an NFR Advocate

The NFR advocate works with the NFR Virtual Team as a representative for their team (or group of teams).  They provide the ability for teams to be involved with the NFR process as well as allow Architecture and COE to gauge the progress/success of the initiative and judge the quality levels of software worked on by those teams.  Through this larger community the Advocates will provide a communication channel from NFR Team out to the teams and back in order to update process, recommend and implement change and provide continuous improvement.  The advocate is also a team member that feels strongly about the continuous improvement process and will support the implementation.

## Expectations of an NFR Advocate

Support the NFR effort at the team level. Help track team progress with respect to NFR. Provide feedback and information to NFR Virtual Team for tracking purposes.

## What an NFR Advocate Does
