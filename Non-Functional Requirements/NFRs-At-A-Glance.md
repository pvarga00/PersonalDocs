# NFRs-At-A-Glance


## What are NFRs (GUMP):
Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are the quality attributes of our systems and processes that we are now putting into practice when developing solutions for our clients.

Functional requirements describe what the system does. Non-functional requirements describe how the system works.

Why do we care? A non-functional requirement specifies how the system should behave; it constrains the system's behavior in ways that make it better.

NFRs can be thought of as "ISMs for creating, developing, and supporting our applications/infrastructure."

Security
NFR security pertains to the management of data within or between your applications/infrastructure. Client information such as personally identifiable information (PII) and personally identifiable financial information (PIFI)—including name, SSN, addresses, and so forth—must be protected.                                 

 
 

Considerations:

Authentication / Authorization
Encryption (PII/PIFI) of Data
Security Testing
Performance
Every application/infrastructure needs to consider and define the critical performance metrics (like transaction/sec, response time, etc.) and work with the Load and Performance team to determine how they can be measured and improved.

 	 	 
 

Considerations:

Load Test: Baseline
Reoccurring Load Tests (Comparing Current Runs vs. Baseline Results)
 

 

Code Coverage
Code coverage is the percentage of your application/infrastructure code that is being unit tested. This percentage can be automatically tracked as part of a Continuous Integration process.

 	 	 
 

Considerations:

Code Coverage %
Number of Passing Tests
Number of Failing Tests
Documentation
Documentation includes items such as Architectural diagrams, Infrastructure/Deployment diagrams, System Integration diagrams, and Data Flow diagrams. It includes anything that your team needs to communicate that will clearly describe your system.

 
 

Considerations:

Architectural Diagrams
Data Flow Diagrams
Deployment Diagrams
 

 

 

 

Monitoring / Alerting
 
 

Considerations:

Systems Management Tooling (Automated Health Alerts and Production Health Monitors)
Logging of Errors
Problem Management
Backup and Restore Tooling
 

 

 

"What To Do" - Getting Started Checklist:
Review the NFR documentation here: Non-Functional Requirements.
Track your NFR compliance progress here: Non-Functional Requirement Tracking.
Identify an "NFR Advocate" for your team, who will help your team ensure that NFRs are a part of your development/support process.
Get your team paired up with a representative from the NFR Virtual team, who will help guide your team through the NFR process.
Create an NFR related Confluence page under your team space to help you consider and implement NFRs for your team.
Add a link to your team's NFR Confluence page to the main NFR tracking space here: Non-Functional Requirement Tracking.
Set your team’s NFR goals for the upcoming quarter or sprint.

Track NFR related work in Confluence, TFS, and JIRA with “NFR” tags for discoverability (guidance is provided here).

Review how well your team accomplished NFR work at the end of the quarter or sprint.

Rinse & Repeat.
