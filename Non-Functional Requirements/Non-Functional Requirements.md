This document includes a list of "non-functional requirements" (NFRs) that development teams <u><strong>must</strong></u> adhere to before deploying a new application or a change to an existing application.

The phrase "non-functional" here refers to those
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="excerpt" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="b48fa209-2a82-4dae-a660-b1e0dc17b2ad"><ac:parameter ac:name="atlassian-macro-output-type">INLINE</ac:parameter><ac:rich-text-body><p><span>items of software engineering that we all say we should be doing, but don't always have time for.</span></p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro> 


Why, you may be asking yourself, are all these 'guidelines' being put into place? My team works great already, and won't going through all of this stuff just slow us down?

Nope. It really won't. In fact, the overarching goal of this set of non-functional requirements is to reduce our time to market *and* to better align all of our teams to the same set of priorities. By paying attention to the fundamentals in this document, we can all achieve greater flexibility and capacity for developing new products, supporting the products and projects we already have in flight and in production, and reduce the risk exposure we take when we grow.

Our greatest goal is to allow us to focus on the specifics of the problems that make us unique, while providing a framework of general principles and guidelines to ensure that our applications scale, perform, interoperate, and—most importantly—protect our clients' critical data from harm. By having a strong foundation of principle approaches, we create a common language and architecture upon which to build our services and applications.

Go forth and be awesome!
