## Productivity (DERP)
- <Words go here>
- DO STUFF!



## What NOT to do (Productivity Killers)
- Productivity does not mean "doing more"
  - It's about getting what matters, what moves the needle, DONE -- while life tries to get in the way

- Unless you change your mindset around productivity and stop trying to get everything done in one day not only will you fail but the quality of what you get done will be drastically reduced

- You are taking too many breaks
  - There seems to be an obsession with Pomodoro timers for productivity. It's crap. It takes around 20 to 30 minutes to get focused entering a state of flow. 
  - Using a Pomodoro timer, you are stopping every 25 minutes -- just as you enter a focus zone
    - Personal Note: Not sure I believe in this for myself, as I'm pretty adept at context switching (#humblebrag). 
      - Flow is readily entered - but it does suck to get yanked out of a flow (prematurely)
      - However, I do believe that the PTimer *IS* good mechanism for __starting a task__ (#motivation, #eat-a-frog-for-breakfast)
  - Instead progressively overload the Pomodoro timer each week by doing slightly longer periods of work until you're doing at least 45 to 60 minutes of work before taking a break

- You wait for the "right time".
  - That sounds like the right idea but it's not. 
  - There is no right time. It doesn't exist. You were waiting because you don't feel ready, and the reason you don't feel ready is because you have no experience.
  - Fortunately you can get experience. Unfortunately the only way to get experiences by starting before you feel ready before the right time

- You put others first
  - again this seems innocent but it's actually crippling.
  - putting others first means you're putting their needs and priorities above your own
  - which means you'll never get anything you need to get done DONE
  - your mind and body will notice that you will feel as if something is wrong or missing and a search you won't be able to fully give to those who you're putting above yourself
  - if you put yourself first, you can then provide fully to those in need/who matter

- You don't experiment
  - You wonder if there's something better out there, some thing which helps you get more done, something that makes it all so much easier?
  - if you don't experiment and try new things you'll never know
  - experiment with one thing at a time analyzing your productivity and progress
  - don't be afraid to make the change in either direction depending on the results

- You aim for perfection
  - we all want to produce the highest quality we can and we should
  - but not if it comes at the cost of preventing us from actually making progress
  - perfection doesn't exist doing our best does exist. Progress exists. Progress over perfection
  - Aim for your best. Aim for progress, but don't aim for perfection
