# 1       Onboarding Requirements

The onboarding strategy for the initial implementation covers our approach for what is required to get a State Farm Agent employed with Quicken Loans (QL) and what it takes to have a State Farm Agent be able to originate loans.

To employ a State Farm agent with QL, the following human resources (HR) tasks must be completed:

- QL conducts background checks
- Agent provides information
- QL provisions agents and provides access to Agent
- QL sends Welcome Package
- Agent completes required training


To have a State Farm Agent be able to originate loans, the following tasks must be completed:

- Redbird provides licensing data to QL
- License transferred to QL
- Branch identified


Note some of the HR tasks may run in parallel with the licensing tasks but may not be completed on the same date. Background checks must be completed with a successful result before a license is transferred. All HR and licensing tasks must be completed prior to a State Farm Agent being able to originate a loan.

## 1.1      Prerequisites  

To start the onboarding process required to implement State Farm agents, the following activities must be completed upfront:

- Draft communication collaboratively that will be distributed to State Farm licensed agents
- Deliver communication to agents
- Identify which agents are interested
- Gain agreement on criteria for agent readiness to transition to Quicken Loans (licensing requirements, all pipeline loans closed out, etc.)
- State Farm uploads excel spreadsheet with the following HR related data on each agent to designated location (first and last name, preferred name, primary phone number, primary email)


## 1.2       Collect Agent Information

Once the data provided by State Farm is uploaded into Workday, Quicken Loans will send an email message to the agents requesting they create an account and log into Workday to input additional data required to initiate the background check.

The additional information needed is:

- Social Security Number (SSN)
- Date of birth
- Drive license number
- State of driver license
- Current address
- City, State and Zip Code


## 1.3      Background Checks

Once the required data is entered into Workday, Quicken Loans will order a background check. If the background check passes, the agent will get a message to log into Workday to provide additional data and provide documentation. If the agent fails the background check, an email notification will be sent to them alerting them of the failed background check and that the process ends here. Quicken Loans will also notify State Farm if an agent fails a background check.

After a successful background check, the agent will need to log into Workday to sign the independent contractor agreement, complete a W9 form and provide ACH information if they would like direct deposit payment.

## 1.4      Provisioning and Access

Once all forms and data have been provided, the agents will be provided an email address (agent [name@rocketprofessional.com](mailto:name@rocketprofessional.com)) and access to the required Quicken Loans systems. These systems include:

- Online Microsoft Outlook (via Office365)
- Saba training tool
- License the World Technology (Agent UI)
- Rocket Professional


The agent will be provided instructions to go to the Microsoft hosted page and set the password for their email account. Once they set their password, a welcome package will be emailed to them.

## 1.5      Welcome Package

The welcome package will be emailed to the agent and will provide information about required training, what support is available, and congratulating them on successfully enrolling into the Rocket Professional program.

## 1.6      Training

Prior to being able to originate loans, agents will be required to take the following training courses within the Saba learning tool:

- Rocket Professional technology Training
- Mortgage 101 Training
- Quicken Loans 101 Training
- Licensing Training (where applicable)


## 1.7      Going Forward

Once agents are onboarded, they will be able to log into Workday to view and update personal information, such as name and address changes. Agents will also be able to view payments and update ACH information when needed in Workday.

For any future training, agents will log in and take the training within the Saba solution.

# 2       Licensing Requirements



The licensing strategy covers our approach for how Quicken Loans will transfer and manage licenses for State Farm agents given that Quicken Loans will sponsor these licenses.

The strategy will cover the following aspects:

- Converting states to becoming 1099 state friendly
- Transfer existing licenses from State Farm to Quicken Loans
- Branch strategy
- Licensing Technology
- Independent Brokerages


## 2.1      1099 Friendly State Conversion

The vision is to convert as many states as possible to be 1099 friendly. To date, good progress has been made towards achieving this goal. As demonstrated in the embedded map, the green represents yes, the blue represents a strong leaning to yes, the purple is unknown, and the red represents no. In addition to the 23 states outlined in the term sheet, we have been able to add 7 additional states.



## 2.2      Prerequisites

Prior to transferring licenses to Quicken Loans, QL will need licensing data. We have prepared a template of the required licensing data that we will provide to Redbird. In order to obtain this information in an efficient matter, we can work together to create an ad hoc report with FINRA.

## 2.3      Branch Strategy

We have several options we are evaluating to meet the branch requirements. Ideally if permitted by state law, we will pursue home licensing. If that is not permissible, Quicken Loans is also evaluating a QL Branch or a State Farm sublease option. We are currently performing an analysis of where all agents are located based on address to better inform our branch strategy.

## 2.4      Transferring Licenses

Once the agent has been onboarded and licensing data has been provided by Redbird, we plan to transfer licenses from State Farm to Quicken. We will prioritize those agents listed in the 23 states where a branch strategy has been finalized in that state. We will also analyze loan volumes to help prioritize.

## 2.5      Licensing Technology

We will provide agents with ability to view and manage all license and training related matters using My License Center.



## 2.6      Independent Brokerages

We propose to focus on independent brokerages
