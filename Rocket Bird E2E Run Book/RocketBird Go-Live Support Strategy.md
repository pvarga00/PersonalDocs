We need to track and analyze the incoming support tickets from Rocket-Bird agents.



Note: We do have a support email - with a team supposedly handling the emails:

[help@rocketprofessional.com](mailto:help@rocketprofessional.com) / 888-600-8707



All tickets will be logged in Cherwell by the Partner Services Team.

(Need to determine escalation/paths to teams/business areas support)



<u>Various Scenarios:</u>

- Locked accounts / resetting passwords (Authentication/Authorization)
- General Questions
- General OnBoarding
- Background Checks
- Workday
- Outlook
- Training (Saba)
- Licensing
- Signatures
- RocketPro
    - Mobile
- Payments




Once items have been logged in Cherwell, items that cannot be "easily processed" by the Partner Services Team (TL: Marcus Graham / TL: Mike DiMaggio), they'll escalate the issues to the "Technology Team" by emailing: [RocketBirdSupport@quickenloans.com](mailto:RocketBirdSupport@quickenloans.com)

... And then we'll process the issues using SharePoint for bug tracking here **[Rocket Bird Bugs/Issues Tracker](https://rockfin.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/RedbirdProgram/Shared%20Documents/RocketBirdGoLiveBugIssueTracker_47087.xlsx?d=w840c29170a724846b29c057d19ee400a&amp;csf=1&amp;e=cQoOxV)**: (Parent Side: [http://shorty/RBGoLive](http://shorty/RBGoLive)) - using the [contacts specified here](https://rockfin.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/RedbirdProgram/Shared%20Documents/RocketBirdGoLiveSupportContacts.xlsx?d=w5bcb2924eb87441da0e40fbfe4c53d73&amp;csf=1&amp;e=SvBXCc)



In order to provide full visibility on the incoming support requests:

1. Configure RocketBird support email alias into the Cherwell Support Ticket email process
2. Identify escalation paths for different RB scenarios/issues (routing to Dev Teams / Business Areas)
3. Common Data Attribute to correlate data (Sub-Category: "RocketBird" - we need a way to track "RB" issues across many different business areas/domains/teams) - this needs to be added to ALL business areas/applications
    1. This is necessary in order to aggregate data across potentially MANY differing business areas/teams - to gather incident info related to RocketBird (only) - across many differing domains
    2. This is ALSO needed for an ease of gathering data and maintenance (not just correlation of data across domains)




We need the following:

1. Support Process: <ac:link><ri:user ri:userkey="8a8903604cb05139014cb2e4fe1d0017"></ri:user></ac:link> / <u>IT Insights</u> team (provides data from Cherwell) : Email : [CherwellSupport@quickenloans.com](mailto:CherwellSupport@quickenloans.com)
2. Visibility: Dan Walker Gabrielle DeBenedictus Greg Hubble : (Email each directly) : <u>IT DI Breaking Silos</u>(provides a dashboard utilizing BIG platform to categorize support tickets based on : severity, business area, dev teams, etc.)
    1. Tracking / summary of support issues
    2. Measurements / KPIs




Here is what the escalation process will look like:

1. An agent calls (888-600-8707) or emails ([help@rocketprofessional.com](mailto:help@rocketprofessional.com)) Partner Services to report an issue.
2. A Cherwell ticket is created.
3. If the PS Specialist CANNOT solve the issue on their own and the issue is related to technology then they email the issue to [RocketBirdSupport@quickenloans.com](mailto:RocketBirdSupport@quickenloans.com)
4. Someone from that distribution that owns the area that is needing the work replies all with a “we’ve got this and are looking into it” to avoid duplicate efforts/responses
5. Issues will be logged at [http://shorty/RBGoLive](http://shorty/RBGoLive "http://shorty/RBGoLive") by the person that responds to the email above and “owns” the issue ([@Sullivan, Erin](mailto:ErinSullivan@quickenloans.com)/[@Sims, Erin](mailto:ErinSims@quickenloans.com) will be monitoring this and can send communication out about the reporting)
6. [@Kvalevog, Jeffrey](mailto:JeffreyKvalevog@quickenloans.com) makes the decision on if the issue is in fact a production issue that must be handled immediately OR if it is an enhancement that can go in the backlog.
7. If it goes in the backlog, he’ll decide priority. If it requires immediate attention, the tech teams will address the issue.
8. The fix then needs to be communicated to [@Pilarski, Karlee](mailto:KarleePilarski@quickenloans.com) either directly or by replying all. Karlee is responsible for translating any solution to a user-friendly format and replying to the Partner Services team with a RESOLUTION email.
9. Partner Services then communicates back with the agent and closes the Cherwell ticket.

The Incident Type, Service and Category will remain the same based on the screen shot below. Here are all the distribution lists for non-tech related issues that we are using to communicate agent issues/questions to other teams:



**Onboarding/Workday (prior to signing the MLO)** - [RedbirdOnboardingSupport@Quickenloans.com](mailto:RedbirdOnboardingSupport@Quickenloans.com)

**Licensing Issues** -  [ForTheBirds@Quickenloans.com](mailto:ForTheBirds@Quickenloans.com)

**Training Escalations** – Select Sub Category: Licensing/Training and select Rocket Professional Training as the Details.  Afterward, click Suggested Team: Rocket Professional Training to create the ticket for the training team.
