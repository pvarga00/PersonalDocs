# About the Software Craftsmanship Community

The Software Craftsmanship Community is the place for you to learn, gain, and share knowledge on all things related to developing quality code. Ask questions, provide solutions for things you’ve learned, and hone your skills – this is the place to discuss ideas (new and old!) and collaborate on techniques on how to best implement awesomeness in your code!



Vision
The Software Craftsmanship IT Community is committed to being a choice for team members to connect, exchange knowledge, and grow. 

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development - by practicing our craft, and helping others to level-up from our shared experiences.  (Ars Longa, Vita Brevis)



Mission
We provide a friendly and collaborative forum for our team members to exchange ideas, share experiences, knowledge, and best practices, and help build relationships.

 What do we do?
Introduce: We share and consider new concepts and solutions
Learn: We perform research & development, proof of concepts, evaluations, and implementation of tooling, frameworks/solutions, and share best practices/industry standards
Improve: We take what we've learned, and extend the knowledge to implement elegant solutions, continuously improving our code and ourselves
Evangelize: We give back to the community by sharing the things we've learned: to individual team members, teams, and communities

How do we do it?
Road shows, Videos, Bullet Time presentations, Community presentations, discussion panels, etc.
Hands-on training of tools and best practices, through classes and individual sessions to enable teams and team members to implement amazing, ridiculously good looking, maintainable, code solutions
Drive communities to collaborate, capture and share knowledge
... With a smile and sense of humor! 

Whom do we do it for?
EVERYONE and EVERYONE:  All Team Members (not just DEVs), Teams, Leadership, FOCs, etc.

What value are we bringing?
Visibility, clarity, best practices, and new ideas with respect to crafting quality code
Subject matter experts (SMEs): Who possess a wealth of knowledge and experience (we've been there / done that / can help you do it too!)
Supporting our network of SMEs to complement our expertise
Passion for building the highest quality software, well crafted code, and code that is a pleasure to work with – Crafting the best code in the universe!
Through these ideas, we have come to value:
Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships 
That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right/bold to be indispensable.
