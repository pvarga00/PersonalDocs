# Software Craftmanship Links / Good Info

## Previous Location: https://confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=188950169

From the "Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship" [site]
As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

Not only working software,
but also well-crafted software
Not only responding to change,
but also steadily adding value

Not only individuals and interactions,
but also a community of professionals

Not only customer collaboration,
but also productive partnerships

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.


## What we want to bring to QL:
Software guidelines
Design Patterns and principles
Anti-patterns
Provide different ways for looking at problems
Be as inclusive and polyglot as possible.

We aren't expecting everyone to agree, always, and instead we expect open minds to have conversations and consideration given

Fallacies of Distributed Computing
CAP Theorem (Also known as: Brewer's Theorem) states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed)
Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures)
