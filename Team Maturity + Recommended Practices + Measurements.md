The table below considers the 'maturity' of a team, and identifies opportunities for teams of varying strengths, and various metrics to consider for each team type.


| Maturity Levels | Current Practices | Suggested Initiatives | Use These Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Novice | You sparingly use SDLC discipline tools (for instance, relying only on version control and issue management) and rely heavily on manual, sequential methodologies and processes.<br><br><br><br>What your team's documentation/processes look like: Spreadsheets and WORD documents, no version control, no unit testing,<br> | Stable teams<br><br>Addressing development silos<br><br>Version tagging<br><br>Automated testing<br><br>Static code analysis<br><br>Service-oriented architecture<br><br>Reusable unit tests<br><br>Continuous Integration<br> | <ul><li>Return on investment</li><li>User satisfaction</li><li>Resource allocation</li><li>Team distribution</li><li>Cycle time</li><li>Throughput</li><li>Development vs. stabilization</li><li>Firefighting</li><li>Methodology</li><li>Steps necessary for authentications</li><li>Personnel necessary for deployment</li><li>Emergency vs. scheduled</li><li>Broken builds</li><li>Issues related to environment parity</li><li>Defect escape rate</li><li>Number of defects</li></ul> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | You have infrastructure tooling in place that is necessary to support development, and you have implemented limited automation and some agile practices. | Configuration as code<br><br>Versioned databases<br><br>Single mainline of code<br><br>Deployment pipelines<br><br>Continuous Testing<br><br>Automated performance and security testing<br><br>Application performance monitoring<br><br>Service virtualization and test data management practices<br> | <ul><li>Earned business value</li><li>Effectiveness and user experience</li><li>Team incentives and empowerment</li><li>Features tied to business cases</li><li>Cycle time</li><li>Throughput</li><li>Repeatable processes</li><li>Burn down</li><li>Velocity Issues related to data synchronization and change</li><li>Automated build functionality</li><li>Projects associated with version control, issue management and deployment tools</li><li>Separation of concerns</li><li>Code and test reviews</li><li>Source code standards and static code analysis</li><li>Test coverage</li><li>Test cycles: Time to detect and resolve</li><li>Dynamic and performance testing</li></ul> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced | You have infrastructure in place to support development and aspects of automated deployment. You use agile and some DevOps development practices. | Continuous development, testing, and deployment<br><br>Infrastructure as code<br><br>Automated business value testing (A/B Testing)<br><br><ac:inline-comment-marker ac:ref="6cb15572-350f-4924-96d2-3991ef4df5a2">Cross-functional teams</ac:inline-comment-marker><br><br>Agile software factories<br><br>Zero-downtime deployments (99.99% available) : Canary testing + Blue/Green Deployments<br> | <ul><li>User adoption, engagement and retention</li><li>Configuration and infrastructure automation</li><li>Issues related to configuration, data center and traffic</li><li>Component coupling, interface versioning and complexity</li><li>Branching by abstraction</li><li>Reusable components</li><li>Zero-downtime deployments</li></ul> |
