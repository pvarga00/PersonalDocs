## Goals:

- Watch and learn as <ac:link><ri:user ri:userkey="ff8080814876fe4e01488df4f2e10007"></ri:user></ac:link> starts from scratch, and creates unit tests for a real application (qFAX)


## Discussion Items:

- New Unit Test Project (Getting started)
- Refactoring Considerations (how to make you life easier)
- Internal (because you cannot test private stuff)
- Seams (adding/breaking apart code for ease of maintainability)
- Parameter Injection (resolving dependencies / delegates)
- Running tests to ensure you can make changes with confience
- Green/Red versus Red/Green Refactoring


## Accomplishments:

- Created initial test project.
- Exposed private method to test assembly.
- Separated code under test from presentation code by introducing "seams".
- Introduced parameter injection to eliminate global variables.
- Created fakes to replace dependencies in code under test.
- Discussed "red, green, refactor".
- Completed first working unit test.
