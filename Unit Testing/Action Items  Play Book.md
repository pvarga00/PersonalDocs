**<u>[ACTION ITEM: WHO WANTS TO HELP OUT?]</u>**



We could use help / volunteers willing to:

-          TEACH UNIT TESTING CONCEPTS [Bullet Time class or similar]

-          IDENTIFY REAL WORLD EXAMPLES TO DEMO [anyone have a good candidate code for refactoring / in need of unit testing?]

-          TIPS / TECHNIQUES ON HOW TO REFACTOR [Guidelines / listing of things to follow?]

***<u>&nbsp;</u>***

Can you find a good real world example / code – that displays a potential for unit testing / opportunity for refactoring?



BONUS: If you find a great example… I’ll branch it, and I might even refactor it and add unit tests for free :) and give it back to you “fixed up with tests”



Also: If you want to help me out giving a BT on Mocking… basically, just be in the room or we can even divvy up the talking points, or hell, give the presentation that would be AWESOME too… whatever you feel comfortable with :)



We could look at various components of the QFax\* suite, create a branch into some other repo… I don’t want it back necessarily because what we do may not be what Scott wants to do unless you want to work with him and Tim on it after November. Our next push for it is in November and they, business, really doesn’t want us to make more changes to it than we need to in the meantime.



I’d be happy to work with you about creating a talk about how we can take this no unit test project to something testable.



Do we need to do more than than a presentation alson? Or is more work really needed to create a series of tutorials about each part of the progression e.g.

-          How to create an small scope integration test to ensure your refactor doesn’t break

-          Different ways to approach the refactor and their pros and cons

- Interfaces
- Stub
- Fake


-          Working with sealed classes

-          Working with classes without a public constructor, using reflection



If we don’t’ create the videos we should at least be able to provide the videos so people can easily find them.



Team, added for awareness and see if anyone is interested in doing this with Peter. If there is interest perhaps this can be a BulletTime, BT, item or even iteration work because I think this addresses a need we have on the team as well.

… Or if you have any ideas on additional ways to increase unit testing on all projects teams, I’m all ears!!

***<u>HOW TO GET ENGINEERS TO UNIT TEST: MEETING NOTES:&nbsp; </u>***





***<u>GOALS:</u>***

- RAISING AWARENESS AROUND UNIT TESTING

- NEED TO GET SEs COMFORTABLE WITH UT PROCESS + DOING UNIT TESTING

- PROVIDE HELPFUL TECHNIQUES – REMOVING BARRIERS TO ADOPTION

- INTRODUCE UNIT TESTING CONCEPTS ON A TEAM-BY-TEAM BASIS [PROCESS]

- BREED MORE EXPERTS [TRAINING]

- INCENTIVIZE / GAMIFY IT [MAKE IT “REAL”]

- % CC - PROJECT TEAMS IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER





***<u>MAKE SEs WANT TO UNIT TEST:</u>***

-          DESCRIBE THE BENEFITS OF UNIT TESTING + SHOW THEM HOW (ANSWER WIIFM QUESTION)

-          KIDNAP THEIR FAMILIES/PETS AND HOLD THEM HOSTAGE

-          ENSURE MESSAGE OF SENIOR LEADERSHIP / BUSINESS SUPPORT

-          BAKE UT INTO REQUIREMENTS/ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- SEE THE UT TASKS ON THE BOARD


- CAUTION: UT NEEDS TO BE IN EVERY TASK / HAVE IT’s OWN TASK FOR A FEATURE

- UTs ARE A PART OF THE DEFINITION OF DONE

- PROPER ESTIMATATION OF TIME FOR UNIT TESTS / CLARITY / CAPACITY / TEAM VELOCITY

-          CODE REVIEWS :: MUST HAVE UTS PRIOR TO CODE REVIEW &gt; CHECK-IN

-          TASK SIZE CRITERIA &gt; ABOVE CRIT &gt; MUST BE REVIEWED BY X # OF ENG/ARCH



*<u>Bonus Notes (Code Reviews):</u>*

CODE REVIEW &gt; SHOW N' TELL &gt; REMOVE CODE SMELLS

- NEED A DEFINED SET OF CR STANDARDS

- SHOW ME CODE ACTUALLY WORKING

- EXPLAIN WHAT CODE DOES

- SHOW ME THE UTs





*<u>General Bonus Thoughts:</u>*

- LEGACY APPS &gt; CLEAN UP &gt; NEED APPROACH



- STANDARDIZED UT FRAMEWORKS?

- TRAINING &gt; STEP-BY-STEP

- NO STANDARDIZATION &gt; JUST USE 1/ANY FRAMEWORK!

- ANY CHANGE &gt; UNIT TEST &gt; SELL IT TO BUSINESS

- BOY SCOUT RULE &gt; FIX CURRENT NEEDS / ANY NEW CHANGES = UNIT TEST IT

- FIRST QUALITY GATE &gt; FIND EARLY &gt; CHEAPER





***<u>BARRIERS / PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:</u>***

- TYPICALLY LEGACY APPS NEED REFACTORING &gt; NEEDS COMMITMENT / TIME / NEED

- TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING (REFACTORING CORRECTLY)

- LACK OF KNOWLEDGE

- KNOWLEDGE SHARES / COMMUNITY HELP

- LEADERSHIP &gt; BUSINESS &gt; PROJECT TEAM &gt; DEVELOPER COMMITMENT TO UNIT TESTING

-

- CONSISTENT DATA / SYSTEMS

- MOCKING / FAKES



***<u>TECHNIQUES / TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES:</u>***

- WHY TEAMS SHOULD BE DOING UNIT TESTING &gt; BENEFITS

- ADD UNIT TESTING TO TEAM PROCESSES &gt; TRAIN HOW TO IMPLEMENT AND TEST

- WHAT IS THE "RIGHT WAY" TO UT

- SEAMS / INTERFACES

- PIECEMEAL &gt; MANAGEABLE &gt; BREAK IT UP

- STRIP OUT BUSINESS LOGIC IF APPLICABLE

- CANNOT WRITE A SIZABLE CHUNK OIF CODE WITHOUT A DESIGN REVIEW FIRST &gt; UTS MUST BE THOUGHT OF

- HOW TO MAKE IT "REAL"





***<u>SOLUTIONS / INITIATIVES:</u>***

***<u>&nbsp;</u>***



***<u>COMMUNITY HELP FOR SEs:</u>***

-          ITIKI: [https://itiki/index.php/Unit\_Testing#UNIT\_TESTING](https://itiki/index.php/Unit_Testing#UNIT_TESTING)

-          Email Distribution List: [IT COMMUNITY UNITTESTING](mailto:ITCOMMUNITYUNITTESTING@Quickenloans.com)

-          Hipchat: [Community] Unit Testing





***<u>FLAGSHIP PROJECT CANDIDATES FOR UNIUT TESTING:</u>***

- Eve [Peter to reach out to Joe G] [IN-PROGRESS]

- Call Center 2.0 [Peter to reach out to Jorden Lowe &gt; The team is on-board with unit testing] [COMPLETED]





***<u>Miscellaneous Action Items:</u>***

Ping Brian Friesen re: McDonalds example?? &gt; COMPLETED &gt; Requested a BT session for “Dependenct Injection”







***<u>NEXT STEPS:</u>***

- Hands on workshops &gt; Teaching SEs how to

- Build a roadmap to success (with UTs)

- What to test &gt; Determine where to implement, the “right” tests

- Need to answer: How do I?... Considerations: big systems, system interdependencies, de-coupling, what defines testable code?

- Real world example with complexity!!
